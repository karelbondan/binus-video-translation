1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
but you may remember

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,040
one of the things we developed was a

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,599
conical pendulum um question

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
algorithm a set of steps right that you

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,840
can take and you can apply them pretty

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,839
much to any conical pendulum question

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,680
and it should do pretty well okay now i

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
should mention right

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,160
algorithms get a bad name

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
and the reason why they get a bad name

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
is because you can use an algorithm

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,080
without understanding why it works right

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,559
so if i gave you something like this

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,200
uh b squared minus four or maybe i'll

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,000
make that a minus

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,960
okay so here's a um here's a pretty

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,719
typical quadratic and you can teach

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
i think in year seven is when you first

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
learn algebra and substitution so you

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,440
could teach a like a 12 year old how to

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,160
do this you can say look

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
the a and the b and the c

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,199
they're meant to be here here and here

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,199
and then you just have to punch it in

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,280
and out you get a number or a pair of

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,199
numbers at the end okay

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,719
that's an algorithm and you can crunch

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
through the algorithm and get to the end

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,640
of the algorithm and get an answer from

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
the algorithm

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,720
without any understanding at all of why

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
okay so what you guys have to make sure

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,080
is as we go through these do you know

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
why we're doing them

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,439
or we revisit it after we go through an

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,600
example of this okay so can you remember

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,000
what were the steps of the algorithm

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,640
the first one's the easiest one good got

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,240
a diagram tell me remind me what goes on

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
the diagram

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,680
mainly it's it's forces that we're

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,680
interested in okay specifically

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
the physical ones give me some examples

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,040
of physical forces that you'll see

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
gravity

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,640
uh tension in a string um

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,360
uh the reaction force off of a surface

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,040
okay so they're all on there

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
after you've drawn that then what do you

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
do

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
you appeal to some like stuff you learn

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,640
like a couple years ago trig or whatever

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
geometry like parallel lines and all

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
that kind of thing why are we doing that

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,000
what's the point of that what's the goal

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
horizontal

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,719
ah not yet we haven't got there yet

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
we've only just done this

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,360
just done this

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
you need to know like forces forces are

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,879
vector quantities right they're vector

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
quantities which means they have two two

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,760
parts what are the two parts

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,319
there's a direction right and then

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,920
there's a magnitude okay so what you're

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,520
doing is

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,040
you work out the direction and magnitude

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
of all of the different forces and you

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,120
use trig to do it right you'll be like

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,400
oh this one's n cos theta or that one's

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,959
t sine alpha or whatever it is okay

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,160
all right after you've worked a lot then

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,160
you resolve the forces

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,280
and of course you resolve them into

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
okay

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
you're sold into two different parts

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,239
right what will you expect

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,640
the vertical forces to resolve to

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
remember it's uniform circular motion

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
should be zero it's not going up and

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,040
down okay it's just making that nice

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,440
horizontal circle okay

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,760
what does the horizontal force or the

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,920
horizontal forces

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
what do they resolve to

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,680
m r omega squared or alternatively if

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
you don't know what angular velocity is

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,920
what's the other way we can write it

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
m v squared on r in case what you're

90
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,200
given in the question is oh it's going

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
around at two meters a second or

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
something like that okay

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
so that's what you're expecting

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
final step

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
solve good

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
depending on whatever it is that they

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
ask you for maybe it's a it's the

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,519
tension or

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:46,120
the reaction force or whatever it is

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,120
you want to solve the force equations

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,599
okay now can we just pause for a second

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,360
like i said algorithms get bad press

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,840
because sometimes people use them

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
without knowing why you do any of them

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
right

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
so

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,159
why these things why that order why are

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
they useful to us

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
a classic example question is

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
what's the tension

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,120
right in fact i'm gonna ask you one of

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
these in a second okay

113
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,120
so what do you need to know

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,799
in order to solve for this to work out

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
the tension

116
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,160
well clearly you need to know what the

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,000
force equations are right horizontal and

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
vertical okay they'll show you some

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
relationship between tension gravity

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,840
reaction force whatever okay but to get

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,759
these well you had to resolve all of the

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,360
forces in the first place so that you

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
equate them to these which is what

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
uniform circular motion does right just

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
like um you know just like in simple

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
harmonic motion you'd say well it's got

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
to do this

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
whoops

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
right so you're like okay i'll fit it

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,400
into that and then i can solve stuff

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
from there okay

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,639
but of course to work out what any of

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,320
these quantities are you need to work

134
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
out how big they are which way they're

135
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
facing what angles are going on and

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
that's where the trig comes in right

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,560
well you're not gonna be able to do much

138
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
useful trigger geometry unless you've

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
got a decent diagram that shows you

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,000
where everything is pointing does that

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,280
make sense do you see how there's logic

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,120
to it please please don't just do these

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,400
because i said so i mean i mean do do

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,479
them because i said so but don't do them

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
only because i said so right

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
you've got to know why

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,000
so let's apply it example

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,000
a hemispherical bowl

149
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,680
let's do it like this

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
let's consider this in general forms

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
general terms

152
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,680
first

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
and then i'll put some specific values

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
on it and we'll solve for a particular

155
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,400
kind of thing okay

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,919
so here you go typical example it's um

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,080
it's a bowl and it's in the shape of

158
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
half a sphere so that's nice and easy to

159
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
work out okay um you've got an angle up

160
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,400
here

161
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
theta

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
okay

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
and you've got this string holding this

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,680
so that it goes in uniform circular

165
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,560
motion okay

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,400
so

167
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,160
let's start we've got the diagram i

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,319
haven't put any forces on here what

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
forces would you like to suggest for me

170
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,960
to draw on

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,240
gravity gravity i'll put tension on a

172
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,639
second gravity is usually the first

173
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,599
place i start okay because it's always

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,919
the same every single time so it's mg

175
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,440
down in that direction okay the next one

176
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,199
suggested was tension okay where's

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,960
tension going

178
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,280
it's going it's going up along the

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
stream okay so something like this

180
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
and we'll call that t

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
okay

182
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,520
tension

183
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
gravity

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,599
are we done

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
ah there's a normal force involved

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,000
because i'm resting on a surface

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,080
but there's a bit of a problem here

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,479
let's go back to our example before

189
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,639
this was yesterday afternoon of the cone

190
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,199
right so it's facing up and i have the

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,120
um i'm drawing on a circle like so and

192
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,759
then i got out my diary and my keys and

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,160
we talked about the reaction force that

194
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,240
that surface that any surface is

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
exerting and it's a normal force right

196
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
so there's a right angle there no

197
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,520
problem okay

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,440
um except

199
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,479
where does my right angle go at the

200
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,240
moment which way does it face because

201
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
the problem is like depending on like if

202
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
i was here or here or here i'll be

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,039
facing all different directions right

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,120
so which way am i going

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,879
tension

206
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,800
now be careful right um if for instance

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
i um let's just let's just do an example

208
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,479
okay

209
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,280
suppose uh it was spinning super super

210
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,759
fast right so it was up and it was the

211
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,440
actual particles over here right okay so

212
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,240
you can see obvious obviously the

213
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,400
tension's going up on the string okay

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
but here it's a little more clear right

215
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,000
because it's a hemisphere so this part

216
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,279
here should be vertical

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,479
i didn't draw very vertical but you get

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,599
the idea so if this is vertical

219
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
which way is the normal

220
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,800
it should be

221
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,320
horizontal right like vertical

222
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,640
perpendicular means

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
horizontal okay so you're going you're

224
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
definitely not going in the same

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
direction as the string right

226
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
so

227
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
tension is going that way from the

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
string but the normal force is facing

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
another direction okay now it's actually

230
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
not that hard to work out when you think

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
about it

232
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,399
here's a circle so now i'm looking um

233
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,399
i'm looking

234
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
right on so i'm looking kind of at an

235
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,880
angle right now downwards into the bowl

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,440
okay but let's sort of go down a little

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,279
lower right so all i can see is just

238
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,320
well i'm just going to chop it in half

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,600
okay now the normal force is going to be

240
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,120
perpendicular to

241
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,560
the tangent force right because that's

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
what tangents and normals do

243
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
but the tangent is perpendicular at the

244
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
point of conduct contact

245
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,360
to what

246
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,440
to the to the radius right

247
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
so in other words this normal force

248
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
right wherever i am it's going to be

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,959
pointed to

250
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
the center that's why if i'm right up

251
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,399
here

252
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,720
i'm pointing horizontally to the that

253
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
midpoint right there okay i'm actually

254
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,519
down here so in order to draw this force

255
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
in i need a bit more information i sort

256
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,480
of cheated you okay so i'm going to rub

257
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,440
off this green pretend bit

258
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
what i really need is i need the center

259
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
i need the center of the

260
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,920
if this ball was a sphere

261
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
wouldn't be a very useful ball but it

262
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,399
would have a center about here wouldn't

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,200
it okay so i'm going to draw that in

264
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
uh

265
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,680
something like that

266
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,399
so there's the center of that

267
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,480
top sort of surface right and that

268
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
along here

269
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,560
that is the direction

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,839
that the normal force is going in right

271
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,279
perpendicular to the surface of the

272
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
okay

273
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
so

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,959
am i done with my diagram have i

275
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,959
accounted for all the physical forces

276
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
i think it looks good i think it looks

277
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
good you've got the string accounted for

278
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
you've got the ball accounted for you're

279
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
gravity accounted for

280
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,399
we're not worrying about friction or

281
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,959
anything like that it's done okay

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,200
so now i need to appeal to

283
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,399
trig and geometry to try and sort these

284
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,680
things out

285
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,079
how big are these things and which

286
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
direction exactly are they facing right

287
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,160
so to do that

288
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,079
actually i should put this over here

289
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
okay i've got my feeder up here i'll

290
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,079
need to call this some other angle

291
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,360
because clearly it is some other angle

292
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
it's not going to be the same as theta

293
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
because they're not parallel right so

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,440
i'm just going to call that alpha is

295
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
that all right

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
now in the past what we've done is we

297
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,839
have drawn more horizontal and vertical

298
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
forces coming off of the particle

299
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,360
because that's where they're acting

300
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
right so i've got in this case i'm going

301
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,800
to have

302
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,200
a vertical component of tension and then

303
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,560
a vertical component of the normal

304
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
and then i'll have a horizontal

305
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
component of each just like this the

306
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,000
same but they're right on top of each

307
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,320
other this is going to be a bad idea so

308
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
i'm just going to draw off to the side

309
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
two

310
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,959
separate diagrams

311
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,000
one for the

312
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,600
tension and one for the normal okay i'm

313
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
just trying to make sure my diagrams are

314
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,880
clear and not make it all muddled up

315
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,880
right let's do the tension first okay so

316
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
there's the actual direction of the

317
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,399
force and now i want the horizontal and

318
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,079
vertical bits right

319
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,639
right angle there

320
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,880
now look at this diagram here where

321
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
would this triangle be situated right in

322
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,959
here right so that's a vertical there

323
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,320
you've got corresponding angles so theta

324
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,480
is up there

325
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,720
happy on that

326
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,760
there's t that's that magnitude okay

327
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,279
that tension right so you use trig in

328
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,639
this trig and you get this right

329
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,279
what's the upward

330
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,480
force what's the vertical part

331
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,200
it's going to be t cos theta because

332
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,320
this is adjacent to the angle i'm after

333
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,399
so t cos theta in that direction and

334
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,680
then horizontally

335
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,680
d sine theta because it's opposite

336
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,200
so far so good now let's worry about the

337
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,200
normal force okay

338
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
like so but you're replaying exactly the

339
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,600
same thing aren't you instead of feeding

340
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,279
you've got the alpha over there so

341
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,959
alpha in the corner you can see it

342
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,959
starts to get quite automatic right once

343
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,000
you know which way things are facing

344
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:12,240
okay so upward here because this is n

345
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,240
you're going to have n cos alpha

346
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
whoops i drew that the wrong direction

347
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,839
sorry

348
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,600
it's going that way

349
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,800
uh n sine

350
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,040
sorry that was a big thing actually you

351
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,279
should note that they are both facing

352
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,120
inward right toward the ball neither of

353
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,320
the forces are making it punch through

354
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,519
the surface of the ball that's kind of

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,839
important

356
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,600
okay

357
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,920
good i'm going to resolve them by saying

358
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
well okay like that this is step two

359
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
done

360
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,399
the vertical thing should be equal to

361
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,519
zero let's do that okay

362
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,519
so vertically

363
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,600
right i've got these two going up and

364
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
this one going down and they should

365
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
cancel out because of newton's third law

366
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,600
okay so that gives me this

367
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,600
t cos theta

368
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,079
alpha

369
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,040
so that's what hap is happening up and

370
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,240
down

371
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,240
and then horizontally

372
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,320
okay now both of these are going in

373
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,639
toward the center both going in toward

374
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,399
the center okay so when i add them

375
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,440
together let's see t sine theta

376
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,399
and n sine alpha right they're both

377
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,120
facing that direction so it'll be

378
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,279
this if we know what angular velocity is

379
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,360
or it'll be this

380
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,800
if we know what linear velocity is and

381
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,920
right now we don't know anything so i'll

382
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,360
just write both you happy with that

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,600
okay so now i'm going to put some

384
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,040
numbers on all of this and i'm going to

385
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
pose two questions to you so let me

386
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,560
write this up and then i'll give you

387
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,600
some time to give it the go yourself

388
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,360
okay

389
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,399
let me give you some angles and lengths

390
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
and

391
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,399
so then here are my two questions

392
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
if the particle's circling the ball

393
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,120
every four seconds

394
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,120
one two three four back to the start one

395
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,440
two three four what's the tension in the

396
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,240
string typical question

397
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,880
this one a little more interesting

398
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
if the particle speeds up

399
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
what happens to the tension in the

400
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,199
string

401
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,000
and can you account for the reason why

402
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,680
it changes the way that it does

403
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,680
have a think about that give that tenant
