1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,480
let's simplify things a little bit okay

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
here's our situation we've got and i'm

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,200
just looking at it so i don't know i'm

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
just interested in the forces so i don't

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,200
need the whole 3d picture okay as we

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,400
already know your gravity that's fine

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,400
okay then you have a normal force

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,240
and in our ideal world situation we

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,800
imagined what would happen if those all

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,720
exactly cancelled out okay if you were

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,119
traveling at the perfect speed and the

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,599
angle angle

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,680
was exactly right okay but as you see

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,680
these things can all change

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
now let's just have an example and we've

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,079
looked at these before right if i'm

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,920
going faster than the optimum speed if

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
i'm going faster than the optimum speed

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,960
what's happening right well that

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,000
additional speed it's pushing me out

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
further right the centripetal force is

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,399
not enough to try and compensate and

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,640
that's why it's going further and

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,120
further away okay so therefore what

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,199
you're going to experience

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,359
is a force in now you're in the car

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,199
right and you've played corners before

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,600
you're going faster and faster you take

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,960
the corner which way are people inside

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,119
the car being flown which way

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
the outside of the turn right because

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,680
guess what

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,439
you passenger you have inertia as well

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
and just like the uh just like the car

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,840
before you want to go off in a tangent

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,200
and that's out of the circle okay so

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,600
you've got what we call a lateral force

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
okay lateral just means sideways

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
you would think oh sideways that means

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
horizontal but we don't want to use that

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,200
word right because horizontal here means

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
that way

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,759
so you've got a lateral force upwards

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
away from the ground i guess

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
but you can imagine the reverse

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,119
situation if you take this and you know

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
you know grandpa's driving or something

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
like that and i'm like no i don't want

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,759
to go so fast okay so the opposite will

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,360
happen okay you're going to have a

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,040
lateral force but it's going to be

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,040
downward okay

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,880
now

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,399
just like

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,399
in other situations where you go up and

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
down you can define whichever you want

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,159
as positive and negative so long as

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
you're consistent and you say what

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,000
you're doing okay but the point is that

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
we've got this new axis involved here

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,720
and it's perpendicular to the um should

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,959
have labeled perpendicular to the normal

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,440
force it's along the road okay that's

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,840
that's the lateral force you experience

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
so let's have a look at this

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,000
example i've given you a road radius

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
don't worry about the mass of the car we

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
don't know what it is

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,720
let's have gravity 9.8 and the road

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
designer has designed the curve so the

71
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
optimum velocity you're meant to take so

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,400
this is obviously a highway road is 120

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,560
kilometers per hour right so here are

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
our questions number one

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
if 120 kilometers per hour is the

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,879
optimum speed how how far should i make

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,519
the embankment right

78
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,840
and then secondly what happens at these

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
speeds what happens if someone comes

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
around and ignores the speed limit and

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
goes 180 kilometers per hour around the

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,519
corner instead

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,760
what lateral force will they be

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
experiencing which way and how much

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
and then likewise the grandpa comes

86
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
along

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,920
and wants to go slower which way will he

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,480
experience a force and how much okay

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,480
so let's have a look at this

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,000
first thing you've got to do is um all

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,560
of these units all of these units

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,200
not in they're not in si they're not

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
in meters or in seconds right so

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
therefore i'm going to start off by

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
saying okay here's um he's part a

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,080
r

97
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,400
r that radius i want that in meters

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,280
don't i sir r equals a thousand

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
okay

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
um i also want the velocity in meters

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,040
per second right so the velocity

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,400
is well how many meters in 120

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,480
kilometers

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
120 000.

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,680
and then it's over how many seconds in

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
an hour and the answer is 3600.

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,840
that's meters and that's seconds okay i

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,200
think it works out is it

109
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,920
50. no it's another awkward number it's

110
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
100 on click

111
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,840
that's right that's i'm thinking apart

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
bit

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
okay so now i've worked out those in the

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
right units okay go back to what we

115
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,400
looked at in the ideal world because

116
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
that's what this is talking about the

117
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,680
ideal theta okay

118
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,479
tan theta i know hold on other way

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,479
around v squared

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
v squared is equal to i think we said

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,320
was it r r g tan theta is that what

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
you've got

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
r g

124
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
tan theta right so theta is what i'm

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,600
trying to find i'll just sum everything

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,080
in you've got a hundred on three squared

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
that's a thousand that's nine point

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,440
eight

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
yeah

130
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
rearrange a little bit what's a hundred

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,720
square

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,880
ten thousand right

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
ten thousand so you'll have

134
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,400
ten left

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
three times nine point eight

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,199
would bat your calculator what do you

137
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,759
get for theta let's do nearest minute

138
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
here's a minute

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
seen it

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,919
what have i got where what oh yes sorry

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
is that

142
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,759
square

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,039
with the right numbers in it someone got

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
a detain invest what do you get

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,680
i'm expecting a pretty small angle

146
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,680
cool yeah it feels right

147
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,280
you're spinner

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
okay so far so good so this is our ideal

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,720
world we've got the right speed okay and

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,360
we've decided what the angle of the road

151
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
is so now this is true for the rest of

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,160
the question okay so we can take that

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,280
right now let's have a look at part b

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,800
part b

155
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,800
and we've got this guy coming around at

156
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,080
180 kilometers per hour right so that's

157
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,400
going to be 180 000

158
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,000
on 3600

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,360
meters per second and i think this is

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
this is the 50 that i was thinking

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
times five

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,319
yeah i think it works out okay

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
so what happens at this point okay being

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,479
that things are not going to balance out

165
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,199
nice and neatly anymore we're gonna get

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,759
something like this okay so i want to

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,319
account for this lateral force right so

168
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
which way would you like to define as

169
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
positive which way do you want do you

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,160
want to be up or do you want to be down

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,160
up okay sure so let's make that

172
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
okay so now what i'm going to do

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
is i'm going to draw myself a new

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
diagram okay so

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,840
like that one but with all of these

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,720
numbers on it okay so let's see here i'm

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
going to go over here

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
okay now there's the normal force right

179
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
but i'm not going to worry about that

180
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
too much what i'm really interested is

181
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
the lateral force because i've already

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
worked out all the bits the the n cos

183
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,880
theta and the ensign theta for the

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,840
normal force that's okay right so if i

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,840
have the lateral force

186
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,560
going up in this direction okay now when

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,639
i want to resolve it i'm going to

188
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,520
horizontal and vertical part so get your

189
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,520
horizontal here

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,440
and you've got a

191
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,440
lateral vertical pump

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,919
here okay so use your geometry

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,319
you have your theta there which we

194
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,720
already know six degrees 28 minutes

195
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,919
corresponding angles so i see there's a

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,560
theta there and a theta there okay so

197
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,639
what do you work out your horizontal

198
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
part of the component to be horizontal

199
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,120
component

200
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,160
that's adjacent right it's adjacent so i

201
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,720
think you're going to get l cos theta

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,240
there going in that direction

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
conversely you have l sine theta going

204
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
upwards

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
okay

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,560
now you already worked out before what

207
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,440
your uh normal forces will be i think

208
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
you've got

209
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,319
n cos theta going that way and and sine

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,879
theta going this way so now when i

211
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,840
resolve everything

212
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
vertically

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
what's going on vertically what's going

214
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
on

215
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,280
you've got the lateral force going

216
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
upwards and you have the normal force

217
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,840
also going upwards right so i think

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
we're going to get l sine theta

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
plus

220
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,640
n

221
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
cos theta is that right yeah and that

222
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,479
should be counteracting

223
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
gravity yep

224
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,800
let's call that one

225
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,800
horizontally what's happening

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
now these forces are acting in opposite

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
directions right so i've got

228
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,880
l cos theta going in the positive

229
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
direction

230
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,880
now hold on a second

231
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,360
we define l cos theta going positive

232
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,839
this way right but in our normal

233
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,560
situation right horizontally i think of

234
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,040
the force toward the center

235
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,120
as positive right so this would be

236
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,040
negative wouldn't it it's going away

237
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
from where the normal's going okay so

238
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
that means i'm going to put i'll put the

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,160
normal first maybe i should have done

240
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,240
that over here

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,600
minus

242
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
l cos theta

243
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
right whichever way they're going

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,640
they're going in opposite directions

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,440
okay so that's m v squared on

246
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
okay now what are we trying to work out

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
i'm trying to find out what's the

248
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,959
lateral force how much is it and which

249
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,279
direction is it facing so in other words

250
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,120
you're solving for l

251
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,800
okay and you've got these two equations

252
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,399
to use i want you to have a think about

253
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,680
this for a second i'll let you have a go

254
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,800
take a couple minutes

255
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,920
what are you going to do to equations

256
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,399
one and two

257
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
so that you can solve for l remember m

258
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
is a constant so you don't need to worry

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,720
about it we know what g is

260
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,240
we know what v is or rather that's what

261
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
v is in this case

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,440
and we know what the radius is okay so

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,519
how are you going to get all of the

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
other stuff the ends and the thetas out

265
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,279
of the picture

266
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,279
and just have l

267
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,160
the problem we are encountering is that

268
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,480
one and two are hard to put together

269
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,839
right but it's not so bad i mean when

270
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,760
you see something like this for

271
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,760
instance awkward number four x

272
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,680
okay yeah all right well if i'm going to

273
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,680
put these two equations together

274
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
i'm going to need to eliminate something

275
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,120
right and the way you would do it here

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
is well for instance suppose you wanted

277
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,560
to eliminate y okay if i want to

278
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,560
eliminate why what i'll do is i'll take

279
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
this whole thing and i'll multiply it by

280
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
two and then i'll take this whole thing

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,959
and then i'll multiply it by five then

282
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,640
i'll have a minus ten y here a plus ten

283
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,120
right here i'll add them and then poof

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,279
it's gone okay that's that's not so hard

285
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
okay you have exactly

286
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,680
exactly the same scenario here it's just

287
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,839
that instead of numbers you've got

288
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,519
fluffy letters and greek stuff okay but

289
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,680
that's all right it works in exactly the

290
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,680
same way watch

291
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
let's take equation one right

292
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
what i want to get rid of is the n cos

293
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,760
theta okay and i see there's a and sine

294
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760
theta here so i don't need to multiply

295
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,360
by n that's common

296
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,920
but if i multiply this one by sine and

297
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,680
this one by cos then they'll be the same

298
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,000
just like these would be the same and

299
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,480
then i can subtract okay so i'll take

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
equation one and i'll multiply that one

301
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
by a sine

302
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,120
and then i'll take away equation two

303
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,760
multiplied by cos

304
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
okay if i do that watch what happens

305
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
right well

306
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,399
you'll get l sine squared

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,079
there right you'll have an n sine theta

308
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,240
cos theta

309
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
subtracting an n sine theta cos theta so

310
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
they're just gonna go

311
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,360
okay and there's minus and then that's a

312
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
negative so double negative so i'll have

313
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,600
plus l

314
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,399
cos squared theta oh how convenient okay

315
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,160
so

316
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
that's good that's good what am i going

317
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,440
to have over here well i multiplied

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,880
things so that makes it a little bit

319
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
messy but that's okay you're going to

320
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
get what mg

321
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,360
sine theta

322
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
minus

323
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,720
mv squared on r cos theta is that all

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
right happy with that

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
let's just tidy up a little bit sine

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
squared plus cos squared that just gives

327
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,320
you 1.

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,200
i'll just take out m i mean it doesn't

329
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
make it a huge amount liter but you are

330
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
going to have m in the final equation

331
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,880
because it's just a constant right so

332
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
you have nothing to evaluate

333
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,920
m sine theta sorry g sine theta

334
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,480
v squared on r

335
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,079
cos theta okay cool now the good thing

336
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,320
about this equation here is we're

337
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,200
putting a box around right

338
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,959
is that it's irrespective of v so i can

339
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
take my two values of v and then just

340
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,600
put them into the same equation and then

341
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
i can get a value for l okay so in the

342
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,519
case of part one what i would do is i

343
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,639
say l equals m it's just going to stay

344
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,720
there

345
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,959
9.8 sine what was theta again like six

346
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,639
degrees right

347
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,519
28 minus okay this time i decided that v

348
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,519
was 50.

349
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,279
um r is a thousand right and you got cos

350
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,000
the same angle

351
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,760
okay now once you get out the end let's

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,639
just round it off a little bit you get

353
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,079
minus 1.38

354
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,959
m

355
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,880
i think okay now

356
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,880
m is going to be positive right it's a

357
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,680
mass so then what does this mean which

358
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,040
way is this force facing and you have a

359
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,839
look and it's

360
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,920
it's going downward okay why is that why

361
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,160
is l going downward we said if you go

362
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,720
faster you get pushed

363
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,040
outwards right

364
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,920
ha now inertia is pushing you out that

365
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,600
way

366
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,720
but this force this force is actually

367
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
friction

368
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
this is what we started with this is the

369
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
thing that's keeping you if there was no

370
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,800
bank right if i was just going around

371
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,079
right then friction is what keeps your

372
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
wheels on the ground remember that

373
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,440
situation we looked at before it was

374
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,440
optimum speed it was perfect everything

375
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,880
balanced out but if everything does not

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
balance out

377
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
then you're going to have friction

378
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,560
quite a lot of it okay depending on the

379
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
mass of your car right now just a quick

380
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
note

381
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
this friction is acting in that way and

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,519
the faster i go the more friction will

383
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,199
be acting that way which is why if

384
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,639
you've ever been driving along on a

385
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,800
highway or something and you're looking

386
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,040
at the road and on the road in front of

387
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
you

388
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,000
you can see there are

389
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
tire marks right these kinds of things

390
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,160
what does that mean where did they come

391
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
from okay well intuition tells you

392
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,120
someone took this corner and they took

393
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,720
it too fast right the faster you take it

394
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
the more friction there will be and

395
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,680
friction as you know it's a force it

396
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,600
causes energy it's hot right so it burns

397
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,320
off part of the tires and that's where

398
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,160
they are right because they took the

399
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,000
corner at a speed that was higher than

400
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,240
the optimum okay

401
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,279
so the friction is acting downwards

402
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,639
otherwise it'll just fly off okay

403
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,160
now if we replay this situation okay and

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
all we have to do to get a new speed is

405
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,079
well this is half it's exactly half so

406
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,720
all i have to do is adjust this number

407
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,839
that's convenient

408
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,880
and when you do that what do you

409
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,880
get 0.52 or something

410
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,519
okay so as you'd expect this time

411
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
friction is still doing its job but what

412
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,240
it's doing is it's acting upward it's

413
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,480
stopping your car from sliding down the

414
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
hill because you're going too slow hurry

415
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,000
up okay but you see what's going on

416
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,120
right too slow friction's got to act up

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,680
if you think about it this way if you

418
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,199
just stopped on the hill right just

419
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
motionless okay

420
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,160
friction is acting on you otherwise

421
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,839
you're going to slide down the heel if

422
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
there's not enough friction oh you just

423
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,920
roll down just like my keys rolled off

424
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,759
the diary okay

425
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,079
but if you're going it won't be so bad

426
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,440
but there will still be some friction

427
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,279
keeping you up in that direction

428
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,920
otherwise you'll slide down the hill

429
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,920
okay
