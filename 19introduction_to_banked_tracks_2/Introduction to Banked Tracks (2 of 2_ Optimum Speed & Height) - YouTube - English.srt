1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,360
this was you know i know it's not a

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,720
conical pendulum but we're still going

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,359
through the same kinds of things we have

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
drawn a diagram right i've put on the

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,719
physical forces that are there

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,240
what do i do next

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,199
i did step one was to draw step two is

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
trig and geometry so that i can work out

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
like this thing when i get towards

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,920
resolving its forces which way is

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
everything facing okay so what i'm going

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,439
to do is i'm just going to take part of

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,439
this diagram this part where the forces

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,480
are draw that out separately so that i

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,480
can understand a little better

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,079
okay so there's the normal force right

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,440
now which way

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,280
are all of the forces and all their

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,640
magnitudes going when i start to resolve

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,239
this thing okay so if you've got some

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
colors there

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,399
you can see there's a horizontal

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,399
component like this

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,799
and you can see importantly that this

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,040
horizontal component of the normal force

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
it's centripetal it's headed towards o

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
so that's good that's what we want it to

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,400
do right so i'll work out what that is

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
in a second

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,960
and then you've got the vertical

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,439
component which is heading off like you

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
would expect

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,240
all right

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,320
so have a look with me

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,720
what angles can we use

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,720
in here what can we take advantage of

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,799
so there's some there's some parallel

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
lines there's some alternate angles if

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,000
you do your work i'm pretty sure you

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,399
should find you know up here you'll have

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
theta alternate angles and because this

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,840
is the normal right that means that

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
these two are complementary so i've got

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,200
90 minus theta there is that all right

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,159
90 minus theta 90 that means that theta

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
is up in this corner

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,640
okay by the same alternate angles you

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,479
can see theta will be over here okay and

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,399
that's all you need to work out what the

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,479
magnitudes of all the forces are okay

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,560
for instance the vertical one right

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
you've got adjacent and you've got

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
hypotenuse we've seen this a few times

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,959
before right starting to get the hang of

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
it this is clearly going to be n plus

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
theta

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,720
right

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,840
and conversely you'll have n sine theta

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
in the horizontal direction

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
so now i've resolved everything now i

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,480
can put it in terms of vertical and

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
horizontal and say well vertically i

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
don't want to be going up and down but

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
horizontally i'm going in this circle

65
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,160
right so

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,160
vertically

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,640
you've got n cos theta going up and

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,000
you've got mg going down right and those

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,319
should be equal to each other right so

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,760
n cos theta equals mg

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
nothing too dramatic there what's

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
happening horizontally

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,680
you've only got a single force acting

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,800
horizontally at the moment anyway okay

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,599
so you've got n sine theta and it's

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,440
going towards the center so that should

77
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,519
be equal to now

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,920
we're used to writing mr omega squared

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,519
first right but being that this is bank

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,080
tracks and we're kind of thinking more

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,680
about cars right we don't see we're not

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
usually driving around like oh wow i'm

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,560
taking this corner at you know pi on

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,560
three radians per second so probably

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,319
rather than mr omega squared we'll do m

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
v squared on r okay i think that that

87
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
makes more sense

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
okay because we will know linear

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,440
velocity

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
now this is in an

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,560
ideal world okay we're going around and

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,239
the only forces acting are exactly

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
balancing each other out you'll see

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,000
shortly what happens when that is not

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
the case okay

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,560
but i want to work out well what is that

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,439
speed at which i should take this corner

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,519
okay

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,280
so how am i going to work this out i've

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,239
got v squared there that's what i want

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,439
to work out okay so if i call this one

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
and call this

103
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,920
two

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,480
which way should i go and what should i

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,120
do should i add subtract

106
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
any takers

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
what's the cleanest way to get to v

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,040
squared and a nice simple sort of

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,600
equation just for v squared and then

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,120
hence v

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
i think we should divide shouldn't we

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,400
right because that'll get rid of the

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,000
ends it'll get rid of the m's

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
uh and you can if you do it this way

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
you'll just get 10 figure right which

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
will be useful for its own thing okay so

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,120
if i divide so i should have said 2

118
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
divided by 1. ends will cancel you'll

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,360
just get that m's will also cancel what

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,800
am i going to get v squared on g

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
r

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,360
alright

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,600
so now if i just rearrange this a little

124
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,440
bit v squared equals g r tan theta okay

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
put a box around that

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,039
put a box around this because

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,080
what this tells you is the optimum speed

128
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
to take this turn this is the optimum or

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
velocity speed it's all squared so it

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,440
doesn't matter in this case okay

131
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,800
this is the optimus p given the radius

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
of the road

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,840
or the curve of the road and whatever

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,440
angle you're in banked at

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,440
now that's fine that's good um but

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
that's sort of assuming the road's

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
already there like it has a given radius

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
it's going to go that far and you can

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,160
measure how the angle is right if i were

140
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
a road designer okay i actually am in

141
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,440
the position where i get to decide what

142
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
these are

143
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,360
based on this right so i'm looking at

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,039
this from a very different point of view

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
okay i'm making the road and i'm

146
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
thinking hmm how far should i embank

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,759
this okay

148
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,600
because i can you know i can put

149
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
whatever amount of dirt and concrete and

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,199
stuff to make this kind of height okay

151
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,039
so how will i do this it's a bit of a

152
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,039
fancy algebraic trick

153
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,199
remember i told you um

154
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,000
this diagram is actually way off scale

155
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,080
right

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
this angle theta is not really going to

157
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,039
be that high and when you think about it

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
like

159
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,520
you think about the roads that you've

160
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
traveled on and if you've been on a

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,160
highway

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,520
and you've seen terms like this they'll

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,680
be very very gentle inclines right in

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
order to take these curves okay so in

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
other words you have small values of

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
theta

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
okay

168
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,479
now one of the things that you might

169
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,800
remember from when you first did the

170
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,560
trigonometry of um sorry the calculus of

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,240
trigonometric functions right

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,560
is that tan theta right and sine theta

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,400
are very close together for small values

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
of theta right because they look like

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,599
i'll just use this empty space

176
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,800
here's sine and then here is tan and

177
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,800
then well it's gone too far

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,840
there's that asymptote of pi on two

179
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
right so in here they're pretty much the

180
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,400
same thing or the difference between

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,440
them is negligible okay so i can say

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,160
sine theta is going to be roughly equal

183
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
to

184
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,120
tan theta

185
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
is that right

186
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,880
okay now what i'm going to do is i'm

187
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
going to substitute that into this line

188
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,400
maybe i'll call this three so i can do

189
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,400
this okay so i'm going to sub into

190
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
three okay

191
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,720
so instead of tan theta over here i'm

192
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,319
going to say that's sine theta and it's

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,400
roughly equal to v squared on gr

194
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
close enough okay and the reason why

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
this is useful the reason why i would go

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,360
to sine theta is because i know what

197
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,000
sine theta is in terms of

198
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
these distances here right

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,160
this hypotenuse is d and this opposite

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,960
side to the angle is h that's what i'm

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:54,639
trying to find right so this is really

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,639
equal to opposite on hypotenuse so yeah

203
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,879
okay now i find the road designer and i

204
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,800
want to work out how high should i make

205
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,960
this embankment right i just have to

206
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
multiply d across

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,800
and then look at what we've got here

208
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
okay

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
before we had optimum speed that's

210
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,560
that's if you the road's already there

211
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
and it already has a given radius at a

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,599
given angle okay but if you're in the

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,599
opposite position you're like i can

214
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,400
decide what i want the road to be then

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
this line

216
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,840
will give you the optimum

217
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,840
height

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,919
of the embankment okay now notice what

219
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
it depends on

220
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,159
it depends on let's go from the bottom

221
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
it depends on r right that's that's the

222
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,760
radius of this row that's probably going

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
to be decided for you right the council

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
is like look this is where the road has

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
to go so they they provide that to you

226
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
depends on gravity constant depends on d

227
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
what was d again

228
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
that's that's the road width isn't it

229
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
again that's decided for you say okay

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,440
well look we need three lanes for this

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
highway or it's one lane or whatever

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
okay

233
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,320
now the final piece is v-square right so

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
it's like look if you know

235
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
where your road has to be how wide you

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,760
know gravity and then if you know

237
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,920
a required speed or if you want a

238
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
particular optimum speed like say oh i

239
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
don't know

240
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,000
a speed limit

241
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
right you say look this is on a highway

242
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
people should be taking this curve at

243
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,440
110 kilometers per hour right instead of

244
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
being in this position where you're the

245
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
driver and you're like how fast should i

246
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,959
go you're in this position you say look

247
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,399
i know how fast they should go and so

248
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
i'm going to substitute that into here

249
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,080
and get a height out does that make

250
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
sense

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,200
okay

252
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,200
so this is all in an ideal world

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
where everything is optimized and

254
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
everything is nice and perfect right

255
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,760
optimum speed optimum height for

256
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,000
everything

257
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,880
but we don't live in an ideal world do

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
we

259
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
people take corners at all different

260
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,680
speeds

261
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,839
people have cars of all different masses

262
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,720
okay so what's going to happen is for

263
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,040
instance you know um suppose this is

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,360
this corner here right and i'm just a

265
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,920
little bit more reckless than you so i'm

266
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,079
like okay speed limit's 110 i just go

267
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
ahead and i take it 110. but everyone

268
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
else all the normal people they're like

269
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
look at the how tight that curve is

270
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
right so people come in and they slow

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
down they approach it maybe 90

272
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,279
kilometers an hour okay

273
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,600
uh or maybe you have like a really heavy

274
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,040
car okay so when you have a heavy car

275
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,640
there's going to be more forces acting

276
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
this direction in this direction right

277
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,399
and i've got a light car so it's going

278
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,399
to go so we have to account for all of

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
these things okay

280
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,079
so this is an ideal world

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,079
you can rule all that off we're going to

282
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
draw a new diagram for a

283
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,480
non-ideal world okay and i need more

284
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,480
space
