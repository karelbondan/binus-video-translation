1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,279
we're looking at circular motion that's

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,359
what we're up to in mechanics okay now

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,519
you were doing some circular motion just

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,080
now right you had your person in the

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,519
middle right and everyone else

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
moving around them in a circle okay i

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
hope you found it interesting there are

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
a few different things that we can

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,199
notice okay first let's go back to the

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,640
beginning

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,160
um at the beginning there was just a

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
couple of you right there just a couple

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
of you

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,560
and i think what was our record speed i

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,320
think it was like one point what

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,320
1.16 1.16

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
seconds

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,280
okay now we're all interested in who can

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
win and how fast you can go and you know

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
how not wiggly you can make your line

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
and so on okay but we have all this

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,360
language to describe like we're more

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,239
than just fast and slow we can say look

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,199
see 1.16 seconds your first scenario

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,440
okay

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,840
um i didn't make you do a um a

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,920
measurement of of how far like you know

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
how far you actually walked but we have

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
a precise measurement for how far that

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,519
person on the outside went if you just

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,080
think in terms of

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,240
an angle right an angle

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
how far was the angle that that person

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,760
traveled to the outside person person on

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
the left how far did they go in whatever

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,280
time

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
as an angle

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,439
they went 360 degrees or you know come

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,920
on we're in calculus land here so we're

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,040
going to go radians that's 2 pi radians

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,200
so it's about 6.28

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
roughly okay

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,320
so because now we have

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,920
um a displacement it's not like a um

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
it's not a length displacement it's an

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
angle displacement that's okay

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,079
we have a displacement and we have a

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
time right so if we have an angular

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,720
displacement

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,680
at a time

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,000
that means we can work out an angular

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,320
speed can't we how fast someone is

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
retaining so for example if we call this

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,439
this

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
ang oh that's not wrong sorry let's try

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
again

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,479
we call this angular displacement

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
because that's how far they went in

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,520
total

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,520
angular displacement

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
equals

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
2 pi radians okay

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
i'm just putting a 6.28 so we can get

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,879
some numbers in our head okay

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,879
well therefore what's the angular speed

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
what angle has it gone through well i

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,760
guess you you divide and i don't have my

68
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,680
calculator out but maybe you do

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
you're close to six wouldn't it maybe a

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
bit under six

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
what do we got

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,760
you can do it exactly

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,319
2 pi divided by

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,800
1.16

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,800
there we go 5.4

76
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,120
5.4

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,959
radians per

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,760
second okay

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
so

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,519
we have this language here of

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
displacement and speed that we're

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
comfortable with but we're just applying

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,640
it to angles no big deal okay

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
now because it's displacement and speed

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
that's what we're familiar with but it's

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
not the displacement and speed or

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,680
velocity that we're used to

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
it's all about angles so therefore you

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
know

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,000
if you call this say well it's an angle

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
what are we usually calling something

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
like theta

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,959
okay

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,159
this here this would be well it's change

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,200
in theta

96
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,040
with respect to time right so this is d

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000
theta on

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,360
dt

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
right

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
but of course we already have a um we

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,040
already have a convention established

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
for how to talk about these kinds of

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,480
things when you're differentiating with

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,920
respect to time because that's such a

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
frequent thing you know when we're

106
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,440
talking about just straight line motion

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
instead of saying x and v and a you

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,799
could call it x and

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,239
x dot and x double dot that dot means it

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,360
means more than a dash it means with

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,720
respect to time okay so this is

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
theta

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
dot

114
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,920
okay same kind of notation just applied

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
english

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
right now let me extend this a little

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,680
more

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,439
this idea of angular motion right it's

119
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,479
so important and it comes up so

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,720
frequently and i don't like dots that

121
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,799
we call it its own special thing

122
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
its own special letter

123
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,440
when we haven't used for a while we call

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,440
this

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,320
we call it

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,720
omega okay that's a lowercase omega not

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,840
to be confused with a um

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
uppercase omega which is ohms i think

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,000
electricity that kind of thing

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
so this omega this is what's talking

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
about angular speed it's just another

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,479
notation you can call it theta dot or

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
you can call it d theta on dt they're

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
all the same thing

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
okay now

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,320
just to push on it a little more just to

137
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
have the picture complete for us we have

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,199
displacement we have speed velocity okay

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
what would round out the picture what's

140
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
left

141
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,280
acceleration right and we can use the

142
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,560
same kinds of logic i can find my view

143
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
marker

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
the same kinds of logic that we had in

145
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,400
straight line motion or in projectile to

146
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
say well how would we write how do we

147
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
express this okay so if we talk about

148
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,520
displacement speed velocity and

149
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
acceleration

150
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
you can say it a whole bunch of

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
different ways that's what happens when

152
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
you get to acceleration we've noticed

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,520
this already when we're looking at our

154
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,800
introductory exercises uh in

155
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,800
acceleration sorry in mechanics

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
we could just say

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
it's this speed this velocity

158
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
differentiated with respect to time okay

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,360
so you could call it d

160
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,000
omega

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
on dt okay it's just i mean we're used

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,520
to saying is dv dt but we don't want to

163
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
confuse v with this velocity okay

164
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
you can write it a whole bunch of

165
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,000
different ways obviously since it's the

166
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
first derivative of this that makes it

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
the second derivative

168
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
of this right so you could equally write

169
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
it d squared

170
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
theta

171
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
on dt squared okay think with me there's

172
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
a few other ways we know to write

173
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,680
acceleration it's just the same kind of

174
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
thing just with different labels give me

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
another example

176
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,520
see a double dot yup you'll see that

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,199
just as many times

178
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
okay another one you can give me another

179
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,840
two we have five ways of writing

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
acceleration right

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
double oh okay yeah all right yeah

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
um

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
that's yeah that's true it doesn't come

184
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,639
up much though i don't know why but i

185
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,120
almost never see that

186
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
um think about ways we expressed

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
acceleration before that were useful to

188
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,840
us in those like f equals m a type

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,199
questions what ways can we write it

190
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,479
yeah good you can go from here right and

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,400
you can say well i can write this as

192
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
um

193
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,199
omega

194
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,680
d

195
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
hold on i've got it written here

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
d omega

197
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,120
on d theta remember how we do that with

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,400
chain rule because omega right that's

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,400
just d theta on dt so if i put d theta

200
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,560
on dt here you see it cancels and it

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,880
gives you back this line okay and

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
there's one more way to write it instead

203
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,360
of half

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
v squared it'll be half omega squared

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
right so you'd say

206
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
d

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
on d theta

208
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
squared it's all the same it's all the

209
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
same it's just

210
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,400
omega's instead of e's and it's just

211
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,160
thetas instead of x's right because

212
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,800
you've got theta representing angular

213
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,199
displacement okay

214
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,240
so you've got this idea this is all

215
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,240
about angular motion

216
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,800
okay so let's do a quick thought

217
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
experiment here right

218
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,639
let's think of our um group of four

219
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
people and they were all going around

220
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,759
okay now what was the time what kind of

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,919
times did we get for four people was

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,560
like three seconds two point three

223
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,759
roughly three seconds okay so

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
think about

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
this person the second person along

226
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
right how long did it take for them to

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,039
go all the way around and back to the

228
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,199
original spot

229
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,879
it's three seconds right

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
what about this third person how long it

231
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
takes for them to go all the way and

232
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
then back to their original spot

233
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
also

234
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,240
three

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
seconds they all take the same amount of

236
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,120
gene that's why everyone's shoulders

237
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,960
were together in theory anyway okay

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
but hold on a second

239
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,879
you've all gone through the same angle

240
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,479
and you've all taken the same time one

241
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
point one six three seconds eight

242
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,560
seconds whatever it was

243
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,640
so your angular motion is the same

244
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
but the motion isn't the same

245
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,000
right get the person on the outside to

246
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
tell you the motion is definitely not

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,279
the same what's the person on the

248
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
outside doing

249
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
they're running they're moving way

250
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
faster than everyone else that lazy guy

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
in the middle he's not going anywhere

252
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
right it's

253
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,000
yeah i know who positioned themselves to

254
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,080
be in the middle okay so therefore

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,399
there's not just angular motion angular

256
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,480
motion doesn't tell the whole story

257
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,160
right there's also now this has a couple

258
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
of different names

259
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,240
i think the most helpful name is linear

260
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
motion

261
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,120
okay because we're not just thinking

262
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,440
about um this angle in here right so if

263
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,640
i if i were to put an axis here

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,720
this angle of two pi radians

265
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,839
we're also thinking about

266
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,240
a line on which they're moving okay so

267
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,920
that is you know this kind of thing

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,200
like a line like that okay and obviously

269
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,240
the further you are away from the center

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,800
the faster that motion is going to be

271
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
okay now how can we express this

272
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
algebraically

273
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
let's think about

274
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,279
just like this let's think about speed

275
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,839
okay so if i talk about whoops linear

276
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
velocity

277
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,360
okay velocity is um

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
is distance over time right distance

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,519
over time

280
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
this this distance right it was an angle

281
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,720
okay

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,720
what about this distance where is it

283
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,760
it's not in a straight line right

284
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
so how do you measure it

285
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
it's a it's a circumference right and

286
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,240
because we're talking in radians we can

287
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
use radian measure language to express

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,760
this this thing is not just a

289
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,800
circumference it's an arc right it's an

290
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,279
arc okay so i'm gonna have the change in

291
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
the arc length

292
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,880
right so it's not straight

293
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,200
and it's distance

294
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,200
over time

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
okay

296
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,760
but we know how to calculate arc length

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
right obviously you need two things

298
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,240
you're going to need the angle you're

299
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,519
going to need the angle and what was the

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,839
other thing that you needed to work out

301
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
i think you need the radius right so i'm

302
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,640
going to say well that's the of r

303
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
theta that's arcing

304
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,839
over

305
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,600
dt okay

306
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
now keep in mind we're just thinking

307
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,920
about circular motion right circular

308
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,279
motion so that means the radius is the

309
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,120
same all the way around so this r right

310
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,079
this is a bit confusing but i think you

311
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,440
guys

312
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
can handle it

313
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
this r is a constant

314
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,440
okay r is a constant so therefore i can

315
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,279
just i just pull it out right and just

316
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,399
take that out so this is going to be

317
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
equal to

318
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
r outside of

319
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,680
d theta or

320
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
dt

321
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
right

322
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,240
hold on

323
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,839
we know d theta onto t is we gave that a

324
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,839
whole name we called it omega

325
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,480
and of course this makes sense right

326
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,720
what's r that's how far you are from the

327
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
center the further you are from the

328
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
center

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,920
right this thing's constant

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,079
this thing's constant but it's bigger

331
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
right so therefore your whole speed is

332
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,079
moving faster this poor guy is running

333
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,519
his little heart out okay

334
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,959
so

335
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,880
that's the picture these are the

336
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,279
equations you've got two different kinds

337
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
of motion you've got angular motion and

338
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,600
you've got linear motion okay

339
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,040
now i told you this had a couple of

340
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
different names

341
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,279
the other kind of name that has and you

342
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,639
can maybe imagine why this is

343
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
in some textbooks it's called

344
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,360
10 gentile motion

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
why do you think they call it that

346
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
yeah it's um if you were to illustrate

347
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,160
it yeah right

348
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
when we talk about velocity velocity is

349
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,519
a derivative right so it tells you kind

350
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,440
of like gradient at a particular point

351
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
and it tells you the gradient of a

352
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
tangent right so if i were to represent

353
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,519
the velocity there at that particular

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,120
point it looked like the tangent going

355
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,040
off in that direction and i guess we'd

356
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,800
draw it longer depending on how fast

357
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
it's going okay
