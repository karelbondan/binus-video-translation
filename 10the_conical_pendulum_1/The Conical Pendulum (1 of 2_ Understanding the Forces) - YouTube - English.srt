1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,080
okay and um right at the beginning of

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
mechanics i showed you this right i said

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,840
okay look suppose you have a weight

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,040
right um you have an object with mass

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,480
and it's suspended on a string okay and

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,199
if it rotates around like this um you've

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
got

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
tension in the string your gravity on it

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
as well okay and the shape that this

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
thing traces out

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,519
is this cone right but it's called the

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,800
conical pendulum because the thing

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,199
that's actually moving around is a

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
pendulum and it's not really a cone like

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,640
we're just imagining the cone that's

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
there okay

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
so since we are generalizing we're going

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,040
to put a whole bunch of labels on this

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,719
and because we're thinking about forces

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
and multiple dimensions all that kind of

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
thing there's going to be a lot so try

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
not to get overwhelmed right so here's

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,440
where we're going to begin

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,320
there is a particle p

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,399
okay so that's what what particle p it's

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,600
sometimes also called a bob

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,800
um

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,399
thankfully there are no roberts in this

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,879
class but anyway

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,519
particle bob whatever it is suspended on

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,240
the end of a string okay

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,880
it has a mass of m kilos so i'll write

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,880
that down over here

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
massive m kilos

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,840
and the length of this string we'll call

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,080
that l for length okay so i'm going to

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,080
do that no i'm going to keep moving this

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,080
color

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,759
okay so that length is l

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
meters right

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,119
uh it's a suspended from this fixed

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
point up here

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,040
fixed point okay would have been

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,880
naturally called f for fixed but that's

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
forces we've been naturally called p for

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,759
point except that's particle so what it

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,759
takes we said you say c i have no idea

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,720
just let's call it that okay

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,520
fixed point up there where it's

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,159
suspended from

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,040
we have an angular velocity

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,840
of

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,520
omega but here's the problem um

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
without making like i'm trying to like

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,159
before make this diagram as um simple as

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
possible i suppose if you were to put

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,879
omega on this diagram

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
it would be here right going well

59
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
actually maybe even here going around

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,319
okay because it's the change in

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
angle right

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
so what we've got here

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,200
that's o the origin around which you've

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,400
got this circle of course it doesn't

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
look circular right now because we're

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
looking at it from this perspective but

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
if we looked at it top down you get a

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
circle okay

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
because the axis nursery the plane of

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,040
this circle is horizontal we call it a

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
horizontal circle which is a bit of a

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
weird phrase like cycles of the same

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,440
whichever way they go but it's talking

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,879
about the plane that it's sitting on

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,239
all right what other person pieces do we

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,000
need um you've got

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,640
a center oh we need a radius we need a

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,280
radius so here's a radius

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,879
r meters from the center to the

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,680
extremities of the motion okay

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,120
and now i want to pose three questions

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,120
and they're all going to be in general

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
terms

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,080
first

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,360
trains and then you random you're 12

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
goals okay

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
here the three questions that i want to

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
ask okay

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
firstly what's what's the tension in the

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,360
string this question gets posed to you

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,080
all the time what is

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
t

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
for tension can we evaluate it in terms

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,599
of all this stuff that's here okay

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
secondly

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,840
um this angle that's formed up here

97
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,959
right this angle between the vertical

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
and the string okay theta

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,680
what is that angle and what does it

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
depend on what makes that angle

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
you can actually start to anticipate

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,000
this what makes that angle you know

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,200
quite small like it's a narrow conical

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,360
pendulum or what makes that angle really

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
really why okay what does it depend on

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,080
what quantities affect it you can start

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
to anticipate some answers right so

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
second thing we're going to look for is

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,400
an expression for theta

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
okay

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,040
final question final question what's the

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,439
height of this whole system

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,439
how far

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,799
how far is the center of the circular

115
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,959
motion

116
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,880
from the point that the string is

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,680
suspended on

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,680
what's this height here

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,440
okay so this is the question right

120
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,360
now where we're going to begin

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
as we usually do with a mechanics

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,880
question is we want to work out where

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
all the forces are okay now you really

124
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,840
will need a few more colors here right

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,440
um the first easiest kind of force to

126
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,199
worry about is gravity because gravity

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,440
is always pretty much the same it's

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,560
always going from the particle by the

129
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,520
way all the forces are going to be

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
centered here from the particle downward

131
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
that's fine

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
okay actually i should do it in oh no

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,039
that color should be fine though um now

134
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,639
what will the force of gravity be in

135
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,639
this situation i've got mass m kilos

136
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,880
gravity is not defined for you as 9.8 or

137
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
10 we can just call it g so the

138
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,080
magnitude of this force will be

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,120
mj simple enough

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,000
okay so that fits easy right

141
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
but then what's the other main force at

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,360
play here

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,199
and where would it go on the diagram

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,360
it's going to be this this tension in

145
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
the string that i'm trying to find okay

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,320
now where is this tension where would be

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,080
a helpful place to illustrate it right

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,280
well it has to come it's acting on the

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,960
particle right so i'm going to start

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,199
from here and it's going in the

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,840
direction of back up to wherever the

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,240
string is fixed okay so i have for

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,400
instance

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,320
i might do it like that

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,080
okay

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,759
so do not confuse um this tension

157
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,680
right with the whole length of the

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
string it's just the force pulling in

159
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,919
that same direction the string is

160
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
pulling in okay

161
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,479
now

162
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,479
where we're going to need to do

163
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,880
work here is to say well

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,039
what are the forces on

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
the particle what are the forces right

166
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,160
so we'll start with the simple one

167
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,319
what is the vertical force on it now i'm

168
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,240
thinking about resultant force resultant

169
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
force okay so vertically

170
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,039
how far is it moving up and down as the

171
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,440
as time progresses

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,360
answer it's not moving up or down at all

173
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
it's just moving in this horizontal

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,440
circle it's just staying in this plane

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,520
okay so vertically there is no motion

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
okay and what that tells you is that

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
this downward force from

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
gravity

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,280
must be counteracted by an equal and

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,680
opposite upward force right where does

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,440
that come from

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
it comes from this tension because this

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,919
tension is offered a direction so

184
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,599
there's going to be a vertical part

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,800
and there's going to be a horizontal

186
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,800
part so let's draw those in

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,080
um

188
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,800
okay so

189
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,880
now that we have at least visually we've

190
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,479
resolved these forces okay we need to

191
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
use a bit of geometry to work out what

192
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,759
are the magnitude of those forces we've

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,840
got their directions handled there but i

194
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
want to know how big they are okay so

195
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,960
we'll do the same trick that we did with

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
the circle on the coordinate plane

197
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,440
before you've got theta up here right

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,919
which means that theta should be where

199
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
should it be

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,560
yeah yeah it's got you've got alternate

201
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,240
angles here don't you

202
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,400
right so you've got it here

203
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
you got it there is that okay and that

204
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
means you also have it you also have

205
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,879
corresponding angles don't you you've

206
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,720
got it in there is that okay

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,919
so that means in this triangle here

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,360
which is right angled okay

209
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,080
i want to know what's the magnitude of

210
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
this vertical force okay it's adjacent

211
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
it's adjacent here this is the

212
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,560
hypotenuse okay so you can probably

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,479
anticipate we've done questions like

214
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,479
this before what is this going to be

215
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,919
it'll be t cos theta right because cos

216
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,440
theta is adjacent on hypotenuse so you

217
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,120
multiply through by the hypotenuse which

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,479
is t so that's t cos

219
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,919
theta okay

220
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
in exactly the same way you can rehearse

221
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,160
that same argument horizontally you're

222
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,360
going to get t

223
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
sine theta

224
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
okay excellent

225
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,000
now

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,519
let's come back to why we were talking

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
about vertical horizontal in the first

228
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
place who's saying there's no motion

229
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
right so you're this downwards this

230
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,200
upwards they must be exactly equal to

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,920
each other in magnitude anyway okay so

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,920
that means something like this

233
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,279
so far so good

234
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,120
okay

235
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,920
horizontally what's happening obviously

236
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,440
something much more interesting right

237
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,120
horizontally

238
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,839
because it's a horizontal circle there

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,800
is motion what kind of motion is there

240
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,080
it's uniform circular motion

241
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,959
okay so that means i can say

242
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,120
that

243
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,160
this inward force right this um this t

244
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,839
sine

245
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
theta what's it equal to

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
it should be it should be we've worked

247
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,839
this out right the force the centripetal

248
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,959
force back toward the center it's m r

249
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,360
omega squared right now just a little

250
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,279
point of reference here um mr omega

251
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,080
squared right that's your resultant

252
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,800
force on the particle in this horizontal

253
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,079
plane okay but you mustn't muscle

254
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,720
mustn't put mr omega squared on your

255
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,399
diagram here's why okay

256
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,880
in this case it just so happens that

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,800
these are exactly the same okay because

258
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
this is the only force pulling it back

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,000
toward the center

260
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
but in other cases in an example i'm

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
going to show you about 10 minutes it's

262
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,839
not like that right there are other

263
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
forces at play and they all add up

264
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,519
together to produce this

265
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,040
this is the resultant force

266
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
right

267
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,760
so being that it is not actually a

268
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,440
physical thing it's not tension it's not

269
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,959
gravity it's what happens when you add

270
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,959
up a whole bunch of other forces you

271
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,800
don't put it on your diagram okay you

272
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,640
can put this and this and this they're

273
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,279
all good okay but this is what happens

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
when you add up all of those

275
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
okay

276
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,480
so far so good

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,800
what should i do at this point what can

278
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
i do where am i headed towards i mean

279
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
this is the first question i'm asking

280
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,399
for tension

281
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,399
what would you do

282
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,959
what's my number someone got suggestions

283
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,040
for what i should number

284
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,040
t

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
good

286
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
call this one

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,480
equation one yeah

288
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,440
equation two what do i do with them

289
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,839
one times plus two times

290
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
hold on multiply this by cause multiply

291
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
this by sine yeah

292
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,680
what's that going to do

293
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,680
you're going to get cos squared sine

294
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,600
squared that's kind of handy isn't so

295
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,600
let's let's try that out okay 1 times

296
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
cos plus

297
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
2

298
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,279
times

299
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,880
sine okay so let's track along with this

300
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
what are you going to get over here

301
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
you're going to have

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
t cos squared theta

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,959
and then you're going to have

304
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,920
m g cos

305
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
theta

306
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,000
yep

307
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,480
over here you'll get t

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,560
sine squared theta

309
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,839
and you'll get m r omega squared

310
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,079
sine

311
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,200
okay so you can see your cos squared and

312
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,480
your sine squared are going to come

313
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,440
together you'll get t over here okay and

314
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,440
that gives you this

315
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,399
okay now

316
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,760
i think we can push a little further on

317
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,320
this i think we can push a little

318
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,720
further on this um the reason why is

319
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
because theta right this is all true by

320
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
the way there's nothing wrong with it

321
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
but i don't know what theta is

322
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
i don't i haven't got to there yet right

323
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
so even though this is true number one

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
it's a it's a bit of a mess number two

325
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,600
it has an unknown in it that i'm kind of

326
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,279
stuck with right now what i do know in

327
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,040
the situation which is very closely

328
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,440
related to theta

329
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,519
is i know what l is i know what l is

330
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,680
they're in the same triangle together

331
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,279
okay so apart from this line here

332
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,639
that's fine

333
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,000
but can i come up with something more

334
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
helpful

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,200
in terms of things i actually know

336
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,200
rather than things that i don't know

337
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,200
hmm
