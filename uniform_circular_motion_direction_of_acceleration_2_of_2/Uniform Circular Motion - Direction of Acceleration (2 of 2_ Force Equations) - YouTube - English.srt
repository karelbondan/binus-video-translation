1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
let's pick up where we left off

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,839
we were um midway through or not way

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,639
through

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,719
introducing circular motion right so for

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,280
the benefit of those who weren't here or

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,440
those whose brains have you know vacated

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
the premises since yesterday let's just

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,080
remember

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
where did we begin

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,520
we went outside we did our demonstration

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,039
and we looked at some vectors we looked

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,080
at them visually and we saw that was

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,760
cool but we saw well visually is nice

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800
but we want something a little more

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,239
concrete and manipulable than that right

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,079
so what we did was we started to think

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,480
about the horizontal and vertical

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,840
components of

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,760
an object

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,840
that is moving in make sure i don't hurt

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
anyone moving in a circle okay so we

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,960
want to understand this you want to see

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
what's going on and so we thought okay

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,680
as with projectile motion we thought

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
about horizontal and vertical components

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
and then we could go from there right so

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
do you remember

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
for displacement what were our

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,640
horizontal and vertical equations we had

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
an x equals and a y equals x is equal to

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:11,040
we thought parametrics right r times

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
cos theta we'll get to omega in a second

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
right omega comes in when we have to do

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
the rate of change down to the next step

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
conversely y coordinate you're going to

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
get r sine theta good

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,799
so this is where we began

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
now as usual when you go from

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
displacement to velocity to acceleration

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,200
you're differentiating with respect to

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,439
time but then we noticed that that's not

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,520
in terms of time it's in terms of theta

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,000
so we had to do a little bit of chain

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,320
rule fancy footwork okay but you may

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,960
remember what we ended up with was

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,720
we used our omega

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,640
right and you remember what was omega

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
about what what quantity is that

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
omega is about angular velocity right in

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
other words it's the change in the angle

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,159
as you're going around okay so just to

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
remind you that was d theta on dt okay

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
so we got this result sorry i should

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
have said dx on dt

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
and then you can play the similar kind

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
of game with y

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,239
your vertical

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440
velocity right and this is r sine theta

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,160
so you don't get a negative out the

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,239
front you're just getting r omega

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,800
cos theta okay

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,720
so i think that's where i left you

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,879
yesterday right

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
when you're going down the ladder and

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,000
you're differentiating with just with

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
respect to time again you have to do the

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
same kind of thing you've got to

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,319
introduce omega again because you're

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
still not with respect to time okay so

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
you're getting

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,400
this is the second derivative we'll do

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
the x's first okay so it's just the

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,239
derivative of this

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,640
derivative with respect to time of minus

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,519
r omega sine theta right the radius and

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
the angular velocity in uniform circular

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,959
motion that's what this is all about

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,720
they're both constants so i'm just going

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,519
to rip them at the front

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,680
minus r omega okay

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,000
and simultaneously i don't want to

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
differentiate with respect to time i

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
want to differentiate with respect to

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,560
theta right so i do this i say well

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
let's make that with respect to theta

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,800
i've got a sine theta in there but to

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,959
compensate

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
i need to multiply by d theta on dt

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
there's the chain rule thing happening

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,040
there so your d theta you can't the d

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
thetas d cancel your thetas cancel leave

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,159
you with that dt that you had with at

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,159
the start so far so good

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,120
that's just omega that omega is going to

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,959
come out here it'll become minus r omega

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,080
squared and then the derivative of the

97
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
fine is just cos

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,799
that's good okay now you can do exactly

99
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,400
the same thing over here i'm just going

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,560
to kind of skip it because it's

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
relatively trivial right

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
similarly it's going to be exactly the

103
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,319
same except with causes instead of sines

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,200
and so on you're going to get d squared

105
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,959
y on dt squared the vertical

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,760
acceleration okay

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,280
it's going to be minus r omega squared

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,040
you do the same thing

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,319
and that cos is going to turn two-way

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,000
sign

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,840
okay

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
so then there's only a quick hop from

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
acceleration to force what's the

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,599
difference between acceleration and

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
force

116
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
mass good so we're just going to

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
multiply so

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,479
this is we traditionally called these

119
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,479
you know f for force but i've got two

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
different forces here and in a second

121
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,960
i'm going to get two more right so i'm

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,360
going to call this the x one and the y

123
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,120
one just so i can distinguish

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,759
and it's just gonna be this times mass

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,840
forces mass times acceleration right so

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,240
you're getting minus

127
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
m r omega squared

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
that

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,240
and minus m r me squared

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,919
that

131
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,919
cool this is good
