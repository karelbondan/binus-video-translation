1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,640
all right now let's just take a breath

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,879
do you remember back to when you were

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,120
first given questions like this

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,200
um something like this i don't know um x

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
squared minus x

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,799
something like that okay now when you

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,240
first met rational functions like this

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,920
and had to learn how to graph them and

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,279
when you learn calculus

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,039
you were so unfamiliar with these and

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,039
there were so many steps for like

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,199
intercepts vertical asymptotes

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,119
horizontal or oblique or whatever

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,760
stationary points there was like 15

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,239
things you had to learn okay and so in

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
order to do this well you kind of had to

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,520
you had to develop an algorithm oh i'm

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200
going to do this and then this and then

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
this and this and so for instance the

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
way that i do it this is my um

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
i've had longer to think about this one

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,160
so i have a nice easy mnemonic for this

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
you factorize first

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
right then you work out what your

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,280
asymptotes are which are just your x and

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
y's you work that out from domain and

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
from the extremities then you work out

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,800
your intercepts and then you

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
use the factors to shade your regions

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,079
and say i'm positive negative blah blah

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
blah anyway okay

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,960
now now if i gave you that question

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
you'd be fine with it because you've

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
been doing it for so long but all of

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
this stuff is fresh okay so i'm gonna

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,439
give you a um an algorithm for going

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
through circular motion questions okay

38
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
now

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,720
i tried and failed to come up with a

40
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,360
nice mnemonic i had no vowels so if you

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,680
can come up with alternative letters for

42
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,119
what i'm about to tell you then um

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
you're more than welcome and i'd love to

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
find out

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
but um there are basically there are

46
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,000
four things you've got to tick off

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
and then you can work on habits okay so

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,079
no prizes

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
from me for working out what's the first

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,439
one

51
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
drawer diving thank you

52
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,600
now the important thing about the

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
diagram is it's got to have all the

54
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,520
forces on it the forces are the

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
important thing because as we go further

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,240
down

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,240
the force equations you've got what

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,719
you're going to need to work with okay

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,759
um importantly

60
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,759
like i said before

61
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,719
don't put on mr omega squared it's the

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
sum of all the resulting forces that are

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,800
set heading back toward the center of

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,599
motion okay but it's not an actual

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,160
physical force like tension or gravity

66
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,160
or or the reaction force off the table

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,879
those kinds of things

68
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,920
so draw a diagram right draw all the

69
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,599
forces on it but don't draw m r omega

70
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
squared okay because it's the sum of

71
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,400
forces

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,959
the second thing you got to do is once

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,160
you draw your big fancy diagram okay you

74
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,640
use a combination of whatever trig

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,840
and geometry you need

76
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,160
to work out now here's the thing right

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
this diagram it's all about the forces

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
okay

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,360
the trigger in the geometry is to work

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,080
out now where are those forces pointed

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
what angles right and how big are those

82
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
forces okay what are the magnitude of

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,160
those forces so you use trig and

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,879
geometry to work that out okay you might

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
be able to guess what three is

86
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,480
when you've got all of those forces in

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
real wacky directions you should resolve

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
them

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
okay

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
almost now

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,959
you you resolve it into the two

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,720
different components right namely um

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,879
horizontal

94
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
right

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,800
okay

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
now once you have those you add them all

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
up you've got all of your horizontal

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
forces they should add up to mr omega

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
squared but all your vertical forces

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680
whatever they are

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,760
um usually by the way

102
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
you've got mr omega squared here and if

103
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,440
it's uniform circular motion then the

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
vertical forces should add up to

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,159
zero

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
okay

107
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
final step and this is the hard part

108
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,200
based on whatever question they're

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,640
asking you

110
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,959
you have to solve the force equations

111
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,159
okay you have a couple of them

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,640
work out what they're trying to ask you

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,239
and then fit in all your information

114
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,400
diagram

115
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
whatever geometry you need resolve out

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
all the forces after you've worked out

117
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,519
the directions

118
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,519
and then solve
