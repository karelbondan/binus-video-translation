1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,879
we're going to get some numbers for this

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,240
okay

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,200
when you circle the ball every four

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,200
seconds we'll get a number

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,120
and then when we increase

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,920
the angular and the linear velocity

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,320
right

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,640
most of you the vast majority of you not

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
everyone but for this vast majority

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,080
including me when i first thought about

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
this question which is bad because i

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,039
designed the question um is i thought

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,560
i thought tension would increase right

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,000
now there's some intuition to that right

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
because we've looked at these kinds of

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
situations before right it's going at

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
this nice gentle speed and i know you're

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,800
not doing it with me but you can imagine

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,040
it's not tugging on my hand the tension

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,200
in the string is not very high now as i

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,640
increase the speed it starts to pull

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,120
more and i have to hold on to it how

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,120
much just going to fly off right so

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
tension in the string as i increase the

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,800
speed

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,000
it's also increasing okay

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
so let's have a look and see what

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
happens to the maths right

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,840
the very first thing i'm going to do

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
most of you executed this just fine is

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,760
i'm going to take all of my constants

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,439
and i'm going to throw them into here

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,720
okay so we'll do vertically first

34
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,880
okay

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
so what do we got here

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
t

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,720
cos pi on 6 which is

38
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,759
round two

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
right

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,200
um plus n

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,200
cause pound four

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
you know enough about me to know i

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,280
really like the conversation you're

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,880
having

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,240
just i mean not everyone got to the same

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,400
point where you were

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,640
is that okay yeah great it's okay

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,880
where are we

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,479
cos alpha what's called alpha

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
cos pi and four it's

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,680
one over two right

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,840
okay

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,600
equals now we know what the mass is and

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,520
gravity that's i should say times 9.8

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,119
okay so far so good

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,240
let's tidy this up a little bit okay

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,439
this is going to be what's that 19.6

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,119
19.6 but i sort of want to clean this up

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,560
a little bit right so i'm going to

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
multiply through by two as well okay so

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,959
what i'm going to get here is that'll be

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,800
root three t multiply this by two you

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,360
get

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
root two

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
okay so this is going to be four times

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
that which is oh i don't know

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
19.6 plus 19.6 which is 30

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
uh

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
8.2 no 9.2

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
9.2 of course there's no product okay

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,640
there you go

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,720
there's equation one which i get from

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,560
vertical forces okay horizontally

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,319
okay i'm going to go here and i'm going

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
to do exactly the same thing i'll just

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
save us a bit of time when you multiply

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,640
it out you should get

78
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,720
t plus this same factor because it's

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,920
signed alpha still one on root two and

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,800
you're going to get i think four

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,760
squared yeah is that right okay

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,560
now in this particular case right i need

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,400
to work out what a meter is right

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,080
um four seconds that's how long

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
that's how long it takes to go how far

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
yeah

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,120
one revolution which is two pi

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
radians

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,680
right

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,680
and i put it in this order because omega

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,440
is radians per second okay so in part a

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,760
omega will be pi on two radians

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,560
per second all good

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,640
okay so when you throw that in uh you

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
square it it'll get you pi

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,720
squared on four four times pi squared on

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,000
four

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,000
pi squared yep

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
okay see

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,319
okay so then what did we do at this

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
point what are we trying to do

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,159
we're trying to solve for tension right

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,400
so you look at these two equations right

104
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
you see that well this number is bigger

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,400
than this so i think you would do one

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
minus two yes

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
save you a bit of time eventually you

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,360
solve for t and i think to one decimal

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,319
place you get 40.1 newtons so far so

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,239
good okay now when you go to part b a

111
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,120
lot of this is the same but what changes

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,400
at what line do i have to adjust things

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,160
line one line two line three line four

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,000
this line doesn't work anymore does it

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,800
because it goes with this which goes

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,520
with this right but that's changed okay

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
so instead of omega being pi on two when

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,400
you crunch this in i think you get two

119
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
pi on three radians per second

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
okay

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
so you're going to get something

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,040
different on this right hand side

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
when you do the same thing and you go

124
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
ahead and solve right the tension in the

125
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,199
string is what is it it's like 20

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
something

127
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,479
29.6

128
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,160
29.6

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
it's less

130
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
the tension in the string

131
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,360
is less how can the tension in the

132
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,039
stream

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,880
be less right it seems to be pulling on

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,400
me more the faster i make it spin

135
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,400
but of course

136
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,320
in this picture there's something

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,919
missing isn't there what's missing from

138
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
this picture

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
what's missing is there's no ball

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
because well frankly i don't have a bowl

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
that's you know that's just this big

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,479
okay

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
but what difference does the ball make

144
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,280
right

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,360
the ball is pushing its reaction force

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,320
is pushing in this direction okay

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,880
now as this thing gets faster right you

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,199
can you can now think of this

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,039
as think about how i said oh okay you

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,960
know so it's pulling on my hand more

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
right it's pulling further away further

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,280
away if i let go it'll really fly right

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,000
but if there's a ball there

154
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,600
the ball's pushing back right and

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,919
because it's pushing more in that

156
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,039
direction because it's going faster

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,840
the ball is also pushing back more right

158
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
so therefore the tension in the string

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
drops

160
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,479
because the reaction force increases

161
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
does that make sense

162
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
it's a bit counter-intuitive right but

163
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
most of us when we anticipated that it

164
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,360
would increase not decrease is because

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,600
we forgot that there's a ball there and

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
it contributes its own force and that

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,479
force changes based on you know you push

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,240
on a table the harder you push on it the

169
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,440
harder it pushes back unless of course

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,400
you know you're really strong when it

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,240
crumbles but i'm not that strong okay

172
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,080
so i picked out this example for two

173
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,240
reasons because the hemisphere is tricky

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,000
because the angle of the normal changes

175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
as opposed to the cone it's always the

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
same it's always the same okay so you

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
need more information to solve it but

178
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,240
secondly it gives you this really cool

179
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,919
counter-intuitive result so i hope you

180
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,039
learned something as you got to this

181
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,039
number and brain exploded okay
