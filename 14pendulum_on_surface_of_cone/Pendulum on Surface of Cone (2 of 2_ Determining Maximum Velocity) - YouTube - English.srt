1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,720
if i know

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
that v equals one okay what's the

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,480
tension

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,880
and what is this reaction force how much

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,799
is it pushing back okay so how am i

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
going to work out tension how do i get

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
that from these two equations

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
i should just add them that'll cancel

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,760
out the normal force okay so i'll go 1

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,400
plus 2 right that'll give me on the left

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
hand side 2 t

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,480
on the right hand side it'll give me

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
let's see 2g on root 3

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,440
plus 4 times v squared and v is defined

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,760
as 1 in this particular case so that

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,000
will be 4.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,680
so then you get t is equal to you divide

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
this will be whatever it is depending on

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
whatever gravity you want okay

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,559
you rehearse the same thing how do i get

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
n instead of adding i should

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,840
subtract the equations so i'll go one

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
minus two

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,879
okay uh i should probably do the other

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,280
one oh yeah no that's fine yeah that's

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,879
okay so you get two n equals and then

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,840
everything's just around the other way

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,080
okay you're going to get um

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
four

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,080
one minus two zero two g on root three

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
minus four

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,200
right you just go from there and you sub

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
in whatever value you want

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,920
for that okay

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
so this is how much the cone is pushing

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,799
okay and this is how much where was it

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
this is how much the string is pulling

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
last question almost there the most

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
interesting one okay

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
i want to know how fast i can spin this

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
thing so it actually will stay on there

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,799
right let me pose you this question

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,479
at what point

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
like in terms of all this at what point

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
would it lift off

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,600
what point would it lift off

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,840
it's it's when the normal right when

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,680
it's no longer exerting any force out

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,320
like the current it stops touching the

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,280
cone right so therefore n should be zero

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,399
right so if i want to solve for n equals

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,320
zero

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,759
equals zero that's what i'm trying to

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,039
find right at that point it stops okay

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,039
where am i going to put this into

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,319
probably

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
this one

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,200
this one

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
because then you're going to get well

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,400
t

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,080
t minus 0 equals 4 v squared okay so now

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
i'm going to solve for v

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,879
what's the tension t on 4 equals v

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
squared

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,560
now don't confuse it don't confuse it

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,640
with

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,200
this part here right because this is a

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,599
particular tension for a particular

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,200
speed what's the tension here

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,599
where i get this from this is equation

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
two right

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,440
if you go to equation one

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,879
when the normal force is zero then your

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
tension is just two g on root three

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,000
two g on root three

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
divided by four

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,840
okay

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,879
so

79
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:13,360
cancel v squared equals g on 2 root 3.

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,440
so this will be the velocity i can go

81
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
and at this particular moment i'll lift

82
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,840
off from the cone okay can't go any

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,840
faster than that that's your upper limit
