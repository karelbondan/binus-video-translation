1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,319
let me walk you through it like i said

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,399
the working is very simple but it's

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,600
about getting over that conceptual hump

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,120
of do i understand what this is all

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,599
talking about okay

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
so oh sorry let's turn this up read the

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
question with me and

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,680
i've got to introduce a couple of terms

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,960
and explain why the significant okay

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,000
so a particle of mass three kilograms

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
first piece of information

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,760
it moves with uniform circular motion so

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,119
that gives us a lot of assumptions about

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,559
the forces and accelerations and

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,719
velocity that's behaving here okay

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,879
it's on a smooth table

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,040
that word's important you'll see that

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,440
come up a lot it's smooth what that

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,440
means is we don't have to worry about

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,960
friction that's basically all that means

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,480
smooth table

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
speed of four meters per second

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,640
okay

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
and it's attached to a fixed point on

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
the table by a light

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
inelastic string okay so

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
it's light it's light meaning that

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
the um

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
the weight of the string right the

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
weight of the string if it's heavy

31
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,840
enough if i have like a super super

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,240
heavy string it's going to influence the

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
forces at play right so when they say

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,479
light that means you don't have to worry

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
about the string and its mass it's not

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,000
really going to play into this situation

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,680
you can disregard it

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,799
uh it's inelastic sorry so i said light

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
that means forget about the weight of

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
the string right inelastic you can tell

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,600
me what that means

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
what does that mean

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,759
it doesn't get longer doesn't get

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
shorter okay so in other words you're

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,799
going to have a constant radius and that

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,759
constant radius is

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,119
2 meters

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,360
okay great

49
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,840
find the tension in the string now

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,320
just like with like with the beginning

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,960
questions under mechanics right f equals

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,920
m a was where you started for like

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,079
95 of the questions okay so for uniform

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
circular mission take that back for

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
circular motion full stop right what

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
makes it circular what keeps it in a

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
circle

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,479
is these equations right if

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,679
the force was any less if the particle

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
would spiral off it would sort of have

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
this like an elliptic or something like

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
that if the force was any greater it

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
would spiral in and it would collide

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,760
with the odor and it wouldn't be

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,120
circular anymore okay so you can start

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,120
with this so here's my starting point

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,360
okay now like we mentioned before

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,519
tension is really just this this force

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,360
right um we're not really going to worry

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,200
about the um the direction of it because

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,319
it's kind of implied okay obviously it's

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
going inwards otherwise it's going to

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,599
fling off to wherever okay now t is a

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
sort of capital t

75
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,160
um because it's pretty obvious that we

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,480
don't care about the temperature of the

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
objects in this context t is fine for

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
tension okay and in the same way because

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,239
i don't worry about the um

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
the direction of this is kind of implied

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,599
i'm just working out this

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,040
really okay

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,560
now think back

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,159
you have to be careful with i mean this

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,440
is kind of death by algebra right you

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,120
have to be careful about what all of

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,599
your pronouns are omega omega how do we

88
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
define omega

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,720
it's angular velocity right now in this

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,800
constant context because it's uniform

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,959
right we can think back to the fact that

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,640
well omega

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,760
right it's related to

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,239
linear velocity in what way how are they

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,239
related

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
oops

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
that linear velocity there linear maybe

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
you can see why they have another term

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
for this right it really is tangential

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
velocity it's going around in this curve

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,480
okay and that's why it's an arc right

102
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
and so what you've got is you've got

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,959
your theta there right and that's

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
changing at a rate of omega and then

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,360
you've got your radius okay so the

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
change in your arc length right that

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,239
velocity

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
is

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,360
r

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
omega does that make sense okay so what

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
you've got here

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
instead of omega i don't want this in

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,319
terms of omegas right i just want to

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
work out the tension and i've got this

115
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,319
this velocity instead right so instead

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,239
of an angular velocity i'm going to sub

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,239
it out for a linear velocity the way

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,320
that i do that is you come down to here

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
and you say well if i've got omegas but

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,000
i want to get rid of them

121
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,320
i'll make it a subject here so this

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,360
should be v on r

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,600
is that okay right so when you come here

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
this is gonna be m r

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,479
v on r

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
squared

127
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,160
is that okay

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,280
so in fact this line is really important

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
um you can really write

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,720
this original force if you want to put

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,320
the minus sign on it right

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,400
in this case it's just a tension but you

133
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,919
can use this another color as you're

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
starting from you can use this as your

135
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,600
starting point

136
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,479
if you don't have things in terms of an

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,400
angular velocity right if you don't have

138
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,639
revolutions per minute but if you have

139
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,240
something like this then why would you

140
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
have a mate why would you have omegas in

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,880
this starting point right you're gonna

142
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
have to get rid of them so that's an

143
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,120
equally valid starting point right

144
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,120
so from there once you've gotten to this

145
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
point you can just punch in your numbers

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
right what's the mass what do we say

147
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,840
three kilos right

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,800
velocity is 4 so v squared will be 16

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,000
and then there's our radius 2.

150
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,000
right so 3 by 16 is 48 divided by 2 that

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,039
gives you 24

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,720
newtons that's the tension in the string

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,160
that's the force acting toward the

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
center

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
okay so far so good

156
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
when we have a look at part b what's it

157
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
asking

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
if the string has a tensile strength of

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,639
15 kilograms okay mark those words with

160
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
me

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
tensile strength we'll come back to

162
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,479
these in a second

163
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,400
15 kilograms

164
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,479
find the greatest angular velocity that

165
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
the mass can have

166
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,120
without the string breaking

167
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,280
okay so what you've got here this

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,800
tensile strength 15 kilograms right what

169
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,720
it's telling you is

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
now now it's forgetting about this speed

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080
right because the question is now what

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
speed can i have right so we're

173
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,759
forgetting about this four that means

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,080
you can forget about this 24 okay

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,639
this is what i'm going to have for my

176
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,360
tension right but because it's 15

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,319
kilograms right you think kilograms

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
really

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,800
the tension is 15 times

180
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,800
gravity right now 9.8 is pretty standard

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,479
10 comes up a lot i don't actually know

182
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
i'm just going to leave it as g for now

183
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
and we can sub in whatever value that

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,919
they say take gravity be equal 10 meters

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,000
per second or whatever okay so 15

186
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,840
now what am i looking for what's the

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,880
question say i want greatest angular

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,120
velocity yes so think

189
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,759
do i want to go with this or do i want

190
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
to go with this

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
angular velocity right i want omega in

192
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,880
there so i'm just going to say well

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,360
that's m r omega squared that's all i

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,039
had to do right that's the tension i

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,680
want so at least that's the maximum

196
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,120
right and then i'm just gonna solve

197
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,479
i know what mass and radius are

198
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,680
right

199
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,840
15

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,000
g okay so now i just have to solve for

201
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:23,360
omega 15 g on six what's that

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,360
five five g on two

203
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,080
we're not really worrying about the um

204
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,039
the thing changing angular direction

205
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
right it's just going to keep going

206
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,520
forward so therefore i can just take the

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,120
positive the square root of

208
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
five g on two

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,960
for positive omega okay so obviously if

210
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,440
you took um if you took g is 10 you'd

211
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,680
have the square root of 25 or the square

212
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,280
root of

213
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,720
24.5 if you use the other value of

214
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,000
gravity okay

215
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,680
so that's all there is to it like i said

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
um just like f equals m is your starting

217
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,400
point for so many mechanics questions in

218
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
general this is the specific kind of m

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
equals m a

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,520
either of these

221
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,800
um that you get with circular motion so

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
that's why it's your starting point as

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,919
soon as you see that

224
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,639
you're like bam that's where i'm gonna

225
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
go

226
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,520
okay
