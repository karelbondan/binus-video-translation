1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,240
now what i want to work out is

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,480
these four things let's get all the

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
information down and then let's work out

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
in terms of rather than the language

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
that they give us like we have all these

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
fancy labels that are sort of helpful

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
markers for us what are we trying to

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
work out

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,760
so they don't give you much information

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,480
do they um they say okay it's it's

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,400
uniform circular motion that's nice it

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,080
doesn't look the same ring to it as

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
simple harmonic motion but anyway you'll

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,080
get used to it it's uniform circular

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,840
motion you've got a um a radius of two

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,160
and it's traveling at 80 revolutions per

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,320
minute which by the way turns out to be

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,719
very important in a second okay

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,120
now what are we trying to work out part

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,200
a they want angular velocity what's our

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,719
name for angular velocity

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
omega good

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,520
so we'll work out that in a second b

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,640
they want the speed speed how do you

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,640
work out speed

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,520
it's going to be now

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,600
there's a change in angle but then we

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
want the change in the arc length so

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,680
getting to our clip you're just going to

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
be multiplying by the radius it's not

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,799
very hard okay

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
that make sense

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,159
yes no okay

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
see

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,360
the magnitude of the acceleration so you

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
got

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,840
acceleration but you just want the

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
magnitude just the size okay and then

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
the last thing

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
you want the period okay let's go

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,560
through them one by one

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,560
that's an a sorry

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,360
how do we work out and give a lot um

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,840
velocity well you've got it going around

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,280
80 times per minute right 80 times per

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,880
minute let's take that as our starting

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
point

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,159
right now every revolution how many

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
radians is it going around

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,240
the answer is two pi right so 80

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,360
revolutions is really code for 80 times

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
2 pi radians okay so now i've got an

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,840
angle and then i can work towards an

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
angular velocity okay now this is um per

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,399
minute

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,719
but i don't want it to be per minute

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,360
right angle velocity omega our units for

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,239
omega are radians per second

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,720
radians per second and that's why you

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,239
have to divide okay so this is really

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
160

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,640
pi

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,239
radians over

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
60 seconds

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,720
right so then you divide through what do

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,400
you get

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,560
80 on eight on three eight on three

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
because i've got a zero don't know

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,760
eight pi on three

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,200
radians

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,360
per second

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,959
happy with that no big deal

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
okay let's move on

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,720
part b

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
wait yes no

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
yeah okay

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
i didn't want to move on if you're not

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
clear okay

79
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,840
um how do i get speed

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,319
speed

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,200
that's just our omega isn't it and i

82
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,640
know what r is it's two so it's just

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,440
going to be two

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,800
pi sorry 16 pi

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,000
on three now

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
what unit will i have

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,720
well it's um

88
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,560
it's two meters right meters i should

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,080
have probably put that up there right

90
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,840
and the great thing about you using

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
radians is that you don't need to do any

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
conversions right this is already now

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,280
meters per second okay

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,720
all right now part c to get to

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
acceleration

96
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,879
how did we get acceleration before

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
we went all the way from

98
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
like displacement velocity acceleration

99
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,959
and so on

100
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,959
how do i get acceleration here

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
who's gotten it hands up i won't ask you

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
but who's got an answer for this

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
good okay anyone else go i'm going to

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
get you to pause two two is not good

105
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
enough okay i want you to go back in

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,200
your notes we already developed this go

107
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
back go back there haven't been that

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,159
many notes under circular motion see if

109
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,159
you can find it where is it

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
have you found

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,880
it know not everyone was here yesterday

112
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,199
but the people who were here yesterday

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,840
it should be there in black and white

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,440
isn't it just r omega squared

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,360
yes yeah

116
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,280
okay it's not that hard right so all

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
you're doing is you're taking this value

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
you've already worked out right so

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,960
there's my radius

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,880
times omega squared

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,880
whatever that works out to be i don't

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,120
know 2 times

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,160
64 128 pi squared

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
on

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
nine

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,360
yes now um it asks for magnitude

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,479
what units have i got here

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,479
meters per second squared

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
cool done

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,479
last bit and after the period how long

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
how long does it take is that what i

132
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,800
mean the period of motion how long does

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,280
it take to go around

134
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,160
okay and we worked out this before right

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,919
you've got two pi radians to go in total

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,160
for one revolution and you divide by

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
your angular velocity right

138
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,639
omega

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,039
so it's going to be 2 pi all over 8 pi

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,600
on 3.

141
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,520
let's see that's a four cancel cancel

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,039
cancel cancel three quarters

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
seconds

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,320
does that make sense as a number

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,520
does that sound about right does it

146
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,199
sound accurate the sound in the picture

147
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,520
i think it does right you've got 60

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,919
seconds the clock the timer goes and

149
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,919
then it goes and when it rounds down

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,680
it's going around 80 times right so it

151
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
has to take less than a second to go all

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,919
the way around it's not that long

153
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,919
okay
