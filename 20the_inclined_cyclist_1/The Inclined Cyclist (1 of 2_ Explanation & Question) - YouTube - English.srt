1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,360
we've been looking at uniform circular

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,360
motion for quite some time

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,200
and we've established the important

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
things right

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,960
in terms of vertical motion because

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,480
we've we've solely been dealing with

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,839
horizontal circles right so we've got

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,359
bird's eye view right now we're looking

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,199
down at this

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,600
vertical motion

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680
no forces acting okay so we don't need

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
to worry about that here but we have

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,599
this

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
centripetal force acting yeah so either

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
in terms of your angular velocity mr

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,079
omega squared or as we looked at this

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,719
morning more helpfully

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
mv squared on r and we realize that that

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,600
can be accounted for by

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
tension and string or gravity or this

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
morning

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,160
bank tracks right so if we sort of

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,079
elevate one part of a road

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
like so at some angle and we're heading

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,680
along

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
this normal force the reaction force is

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,840
pushing you toward the center right so

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,840
you stay on the road

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,640
now

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,720
here's the problem though

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
when you don't have a bait track you

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,760
don't have a bank track how do you do

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
this we've already discussed that you've

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
got like you know friction on the wheels

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,759
and that's good okay

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,360
but as you'll see in a second sometimes

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
you don't have much friction on the

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,200
wheels to count on

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
example

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
let's have a look

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,920
now

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
i had to show you this because i thought

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
okay

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,439
not everyone can ride a bike i can't

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,759
assume this anymore now as the song as

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,360
this cyclist is rounding his corner you

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,439
can see what's going on i know the

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,720
camera is a slight angle

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
but you can see what's happening in a

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,439
second there's a shot which i'm going to

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,720
freeze that makes it really really

52
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,320
obvious okay

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,240
in order to go around the turn and to be

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
able to do it at sufficient velocity to

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,079
you know he's trying to go pretty fast

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
you can see what he's doing

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,479
perfect

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,040
he doesn't have an embankment right

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,719
instead he's banking well he's banking

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
himself actually

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,560
in terms of aircraft if you've got a

62
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,280
plane that's like this to turn from side

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
to side they call it banking right so

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
this is the scenario that we've got and

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
this is what we're going to finish with

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,879
so

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
let's draw ourselves a fresh diagram

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,959
let's imagine looking onto this guy and

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,680
i'm not even gonna bother trying to draw

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,840
a cyclist okay but if we have the

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,840
vertical okay

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,400
like this this is upright so let's

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,640
imagine this is a cyclist just cycling

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,440
on a normal straight path no problems

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,519
okay

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,519
but he's off at an angle so he's off

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
something like this

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,200
okay so

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,319
there's my cyclist can you see it's a

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
cyclist

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,920
now

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,360
because he is banking because he's

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,360
banking right

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,599
friction is no longer acting in the same

85
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,159
way as it would if he was just upright

86
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,959
okay in fact friction is taking him this

87
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
way

88
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
okay does that make sense now it's a

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
horizontal row it's a horizontal row so

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,840
this is the norm the reaction force okay

91
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
and this over here

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
it's f not for force but for friction

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,440
okay makes sense

94
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,080
now what we want is for him to

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,680
bank at just the right amount at just

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
the right angle

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,360
such that

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
he's going to head in but he's not going

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
to topple okay now how do we make sure

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,040
things don't topple i want you to think

101
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,720
back to when we had

102
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,560
the keys on top of a flat surface

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
so when you look at this scenario here's

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
my keys

105
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
now what makes this a stable situation

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
i'll get these strings out of the way

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
what makes this a stable situation

108
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,480
is that

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,640
friction here is acting directly onto

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,239
the body so it's not going anywhere

111
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
right so if you were to draw the

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
friction force here well it's not moving

113
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,480
but it would be facing in this direction

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
the same direction as the normal okay in

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,040
this situation it's going in another

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,280
direction because he is banking okay

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,120
and when you add up these two forces

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,120
together in order to make it stable

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,760
you want the sum of these two forces the

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
resultant force to be going just like

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,760
with the keys right

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
exactly in line with the object because

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,639
if it's not for instance

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,040
suppose he banked so far over that the

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,440
resultant force was not this way but you

126
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
know say over this way what would happen

127
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,919
to the cyclist

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
he'd fall over right because his body is

129
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,120
this way force is acting this way and

130
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,080
down he goes okay so what we want is for

131
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,560
these angles to match up exactly

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,560
so that

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,600
the resultant force lines up exactly

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
with the cyclist like so

135
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
okay so we're going to call that

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
r for resultant force i know that we

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
were trying to avoid putting on

138
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
forces that aren't really forces that's

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
the sum of two forces but i'm putting it

140
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,840
here so you can see it's got to line up

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,160
with the cyclist we might even label him

142
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,160
as such

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,759
okay now

144
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,120
we need more information on here in

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
order to resolve the forces and see

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,400
what's going on okay so when you had a

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,160
bank track it made sense to say well

148
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,639
we'll call that angle theta that's the

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
most sensible place to put it

150
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
that's the

151
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
inclination from the horizontal okay now

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
where do you think would be the most

153
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,120
sensible place to put an angle

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,960
on this diagram let me label some things

155
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
let's call this a

156
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
b

157
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
c

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,520
d so now we've got a coordinate system

159
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,039
which angle would you name which angle

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
do you think is the most appropriate to

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,120
say

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,440
here's an angle that represents how far

163
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
i'm banked how far i'm inclined what do

164
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,160
you think

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
d

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,600
db which

167
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,840
dba who reckons dba ybd quite a few of

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
you okay now hands down

169
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,759
obviously you can see i can define any

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
angle i like i think abd is a good

171
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,560
choice though

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,720
it is a good choice okay so i'm going to

173
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
put theta here the reason why i think

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
it's a good choice because what's the

175
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
normal situation the regular situation

176
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,440
you're cycling along and you are up

177
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
right

178
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
so you would say i'm at zero degrees

179
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,680
that's my normal situation just like

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
here what's the normal situation of a

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,720
road

182
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,520
horizontal right so here theta is how

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
much am i changing from the horizontal

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,360
but because we're talking about a

185
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,680
cyclist is usually vertical right the

186
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
change is measured from the body

187
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
okay

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,440
so far so good so let's try and resolve

189
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
the forces here and see what's going on

190
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,560
okay um if i've got a

191
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,960
theta over here i can join up some

192
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,479
right angle triangles here okay okay so

193
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,000
i've got right in each other here my

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,919
name over here and there's theta okay

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
so the two forces that i'm interested in

196
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,280
right f magnitude along that way and

197
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,840
magnitude up that way okay

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,840
they're related by well if you put f up

199
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,199
here okay because i've got um i've got

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
opposite sides of a rectangle here no

201
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,440
problems right in relation to theta have

202
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,680
a look at this triangle here abd

203
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,199
just put it out on its own right you've

204
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,360
got the friction force going in that

205
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,800
direction you've got your normal force

206
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
going in that direction and there's

207
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,720
theta so what trig ratio would you

208
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
choose

209
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,360
you'd choose tan wouldn't you you can

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,639
say tan theta

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,880
that's equal to f over n okay so that's

212
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
useful because it relates these two via

213
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
the angle that we've got okay

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,240
so now that you've done that we've got

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
the diagram we've done triggering

216
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,240
geometry that's pretty much all there is

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,039
to it what would be your third step

218
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,680
think back to the conical pendulum

219
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,440
we want to resolve right horizontally

220
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
vertically okay

221
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
so

222
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,280
horizontally actually vertically first

223
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,440
because vertically simpler

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,759
what forces are there what forces can

225
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
you see

226
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,199
you've just got one vertical force n

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,319
right and it should be well he's on a

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,680
flat road

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,120
he's we don't want him to be bumping up

230
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
and down or digging into the ground

231
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
right so you've got that force exactly

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,039
equal and opposite to

233
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,000
gravity right so in fact we really

234
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,599
should put that here

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
so that's what's happening vertically

236
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,840
okay

237
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,919
what about horizontally this is a little

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,919
more interesting

239
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,639
what's the only force that's acting

240
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,639
horizontally in this case

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
it's the centripetal force which in this

242
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,080
case is just owing to friction right

243
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
because it's banking over and friction

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
is going that way so the friction should

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
be equal to

246
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
now

247
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,760
we're talking about a cyclist right so

248
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,440
is he likely to think in terms of

249
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,440
radians per second

250
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,080
probably not right so therefore we'll go

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,519
with mv squared on r

252
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
all good

253
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,760
okay so can you see how i can put one

254
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
two

255
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
three

256
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,279
together

257
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,040
how would you do it what would be a nice

258
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,040
neat way of putting them together

259
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,399
we can do some division right what would

260
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,399
you divide by

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,399
i've got f over n here right i've got f

262
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
here and n so i'm gonna go with three on

263
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
two

264
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
i think that's the way that i would do

265
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
it okay because that will let me bring

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,040
tan into it okay so that gives me on the

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,399
left hand side f over m

268
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
what does it give you on the right hand

269
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
side

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279
v squared

271
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
on rg

272
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
so fast for me

273
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,240
so you're getting this 10 feet up from

274
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
equation one right

275
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,320
now does this look familiar

276
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,399
this should look familiar this is almost

277
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,160
exactly the same as what we saw with the

278
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
bank track right

279
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
shouldn't surprise us because what the

280
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,160
cyclist is trying to do is mimic this

281
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,360
situation except he just doesn't have

282
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,440
obey he's making it in his body okay

283
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,040
so what i really want is the angle theta

284
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,040
equals so i've got tan inverse

285
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,160
they go okay so that that's how i find

286
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,279
the angle of inclination away from the

287
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,000
vertical

288
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,440
based on how fast i'm going and what's

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,200
the corner that i have to go around how

290
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
big is it or how small is it okay
