1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
well we want to go from thinking about

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,879
the horizontal stuff too

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
well i'm not actually moving mainly in

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,960
horizontal and vertical directions like

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
i'm moving around this thing and you may

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,559
recall

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,880
at any given point right my velocity at

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,640
this point it's going off on a tangent

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
like literally it's going off on a

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,080
tangent right so i don't want to think

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,199
about the up down i want to think about

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
how they relate to round and round okay

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
so the first thing i'm going to do is

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,920
i'm going to illustrate these two forces

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,920
onto this diagram here's a point okay

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,680
and i'm going to put the x force well

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
it's going to be going

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,680
in this direction okay the reason why it

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
has to be this direction is because if

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,520
i'm on a cartesian plane you know how

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
usually in a um

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,960
in a mechanics question forces all kinds

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,719
of things we kind of decide oh i'm going

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
to make positive this way i'm going to

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,680
make positive this way or whatever

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
but once you're on a cartesian plane

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,199
positive and negative have kind of

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,440
already been decided for you haven't you

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,559
that's got to be positive and that's got

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,960
to be positive right so this force is

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
facing in this direction

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,600
now keep in mind

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,439
it's a minus sign right so therefore the

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
resultant force is actually going that

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
way right but i have to draw the

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,640
line this way so that the minus makes

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,240
sense okay so this force

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,640
is the horizontal force okay

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,240
now i have also a vertical force so i'm

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
going to put that up like this

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,880
now i'm trying to think of this in terms

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,680
of not just horizontal and vertical but

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
round and round okay so here we go cue

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
another color

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,640
what i want to think about is there's

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,399
going to be a tangent force right when i

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,119
add these two up there's going to be a

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,720
force that's pushing me around okay so

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,360
i'm going to put inside sort of like a

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,200
tangent axis if you like

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
something like this i guess

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
that's a terrible tangent but you get

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
the idea okay so there's a force that's

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
going this way

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,960
and then there's also a force that's

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,479
kind of relative to the center right so

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,479
it's going kind of like this

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
oh i missed oh well it's close enough

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
okay

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
so

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,080
you've got a a tangential force okay so

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,239
we'll call this our tangent axis if you

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,560
like now hold on a second

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
if this is a tangent axis that makes

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,959
sense

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
but what do you think you would call

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
what's a suitable name using the

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,440
language that we know

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
for this other axis that's perpendicular

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
to it

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
probably the normal right it's the

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,680
normal to the circle you can see it's

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,879
perpendicular it's 90 degrees there okay

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
so

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
along this axis i'm going to have a

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
tangent force okay um let's call that

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,000
direction of motion this way it tends to

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,200
be that way so i've got my

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,040
f

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,640
i'll make it a capital c

81
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
t this way there's a force going that

82
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
way

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,239
and there's also a force going this way

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,159
this is the normal okay i'm making

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
positive away from the origin because it

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,239
makes me further away from the origin if

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,560
that makes sense so i've got positive

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,480
this way and i've got positive

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
this way okay

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,959
so far so good

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,599
so now my question is how do i relate

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,959
these two forces

93
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,000
in terms of these two forces

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,280
if you want to think about it this way

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
do you remember when we were doing

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,239
volumes right and if you get a volume

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
that's weird shaped uh something like

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
this

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
do you remember this guy right so you

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,879
take the hyperbola right and then you

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
say well let's take the line y equals x

102
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,159
instead right because we can rotate it

103
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,640
around that and we can still form a

104
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,560
volume right we did that okay

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,040
but here you could see that instead of

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,879
having well x and y then it's not very

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,959
useful to slice the shape across that

108
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,720
way you don't get useful cross-section

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
you don't get slices and you don't get

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,560
similar things and you don't get shells

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
you get nothing useful so that's why we

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
changed it

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
in terms of this we call that kind of

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,840
like the height axis right so we're

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,159
doing exactly the same thing

116
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
here we're converting horizontal

117
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,159
vertical

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,280
into tangent and normal right

119
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,840
so what we're going to need is some trig

120
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,919
cue color number three all right

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
so for instance let's just think about

122
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,759
this horizontal force

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,800
can you see that the horizontal force

124
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,440
contributes some to the normal

125
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
and some to the tangent okay

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,240
and you can show that with some fancy

127
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,240
triangles okay so here we go i've got

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,240
this

129
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,919
okay so what have i just drawn in red

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
what i've just drawn in red is

131
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,840
how much of the

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,880
horizontal force contributes this

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
direction

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,639
and how much of the horizontal force

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
contributes this direction to each of

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,520
these two new axes that i'm defining

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,360
okay now in order to convert from this

138
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,960
to realize okay part of it's over here

139
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,680
and pilots over here i'm going to need

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,000
some intrigue to help me okay so

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,479
we already know that we're defining

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
theta right as your angle around and

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,680
around and around right so that would be

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,039
here i guess there's theta okay

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
at the same time i suppose even though

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,639
it's not super relevant but

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,160
we're going around in this direction

148
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,199
right and that angular velocity that's

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,440
omega okay so i've got

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
that going forward okay

151
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,880
now if that's where theta is that's

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,199
where theta is

153
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,199
where else is theta

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,120
up here that is useful to you

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
then have a look okay keep in mind

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
you've got an x-axis here

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,479
and then you've got the force in the

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,199
x-direction so these two lines are

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,360
parallel does that make sense right

160
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,000
so therefore where do you see theta

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
where's theta

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,639
now

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,000
i can see people pointing uh it would

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
help if i had some letters here right

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,080
and the textbook in fact does put

166
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,240
letters it's it's like you know a b c d

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
e f g you know i'm avoiding putting

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
those on because the diagram just kind

169
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,039
of dies when you put all like 100

170
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,479
letters on there

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
i think you can see those corresponding

172
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,880
angles on parallel lines

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,759
so i see a theta there does that make

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
sense

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,000
okay

176
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,560
now that means that i can work out what

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
this force is over here okay because

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
what you've got is

179
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
i've formed some right angle triangles

180
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
in here you're all these forces that are

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,120
perpendicular to each other that's why

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,039
i'm resolving that

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
okay now just have a look in this little

184
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
triangle have a look in this little

185
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,080
triangle i'll just draw it over here if

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,080
you like

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,360
okay now you've got the horizontal force

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,360
going this way so this side has this

189
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,440
length because remember the length of

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
this is is important it represents how

191
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,199
much force there is if it was little

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
it'd be a very small force okay

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,720
so that's fx and i'm trying to find out

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
what this is

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
right and i've already determined

196
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,400
through treatment that's well sorry

197
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,440
through geometry but that's the

198
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,759
how would you express that side that

199
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,759
force

200
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,880
question mark

201
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,039
i've got um i've got a right angle

202
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
triangle i can just use right angle

203
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,280
triangle tree color what's the ratio

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,080
that relates these two sides

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,120
it's

206
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,039
cos right cos of theta

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,479
is adjacent

208
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,560
on

209
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,479
hypotenuse right

210
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,880
so therefore this unknown side which

211
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,919
represents this force along the normal

212
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,680
direction away from the origin right

213
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,360
that force is f x cos theta that's the

214
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,440
part of the horizontal force that's

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,599
going in that direction okay so let me

216
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,080
put that in color

217
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,840
f x cos theta okay that's good

218
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
but i'm not done yet i want to know

219
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,560
about the part of this because there's

220
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
another part that's going in this

221
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,000
direction along this tangent axis right

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
how am i going to work it out

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
we use corresponding angles to get from

224
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
here to here

225
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,360
right what else can i use

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
look carefully

227
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
i can do um surely i can do some

228
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,680
alternate angles as well right because

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
all these things are perpendicular

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
parallel it looks to me like i have a

231
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
theta here you see that alternate angles

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
there's your there's your z for zoro

233
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,399
okay so i can do the same thing i can

234
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,360
replay it i'll save you a bit of time

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,200
you're going to get f x sine theta

236
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,479
in that direction okay you can you can

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
draw yourself up a new triangle just

238
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
like this but it's not that hard to see

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,120
okay
