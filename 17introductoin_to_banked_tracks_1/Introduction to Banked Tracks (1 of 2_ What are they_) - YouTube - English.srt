1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,680
so far in circular motion

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,080
uh we've looked at the fact that if

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,679
we've got and we really spent the bulk

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,120
of our time on uniform circular motion

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,559
because that's what most of it is and

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,839
when it's not uniform you can't do as

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,160
many interesting things with it

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
any kind of circular motion

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
you've got to have some kind of

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
centripetal force essentially before you

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,640
remember what that means it's facing

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,640
toward the center right we looked at

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
this and we said well that that force

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
that's acting toward the center right it

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
can come from a variety of things it

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
might come from

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,640
tension in a string some kind of medium

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
like that right it might come from if

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
this is like you know a celestial body

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,120
or planet something like that that force

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,520
might come from gravity okay

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,719
and we noticed that it had to be just

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:58,079
the right amount of force it had to be

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:00,239
m r omega squared or or m v squared on r

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
right what would happen if it was just a

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,600
little bit too much force pulling toward

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,600
the center what would happen

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
it would spiral in that's exactly right

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,159
um this force is just enough to change

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
the direction of velocity so it goes

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,840
around at this curve but if it's too

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,080
great it will change it too much right

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
and it'll start to go inward

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,759
and if it's not enough conversely what

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,920
would happen

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,759
it would spiral outwards right it would

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
go wee and it wouldn't it wouldn't get

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,159
caught okay

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
so

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,320
these are the two ideas that we've been

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
looking at right

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,400
but i have this question to you right uh

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,280
we were talking about strings with

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,759
tension or um planets with gravity

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,880
we actually observe though many things

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,880
that move in circles like this okay but

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
there's no string holding the thing in

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,079
and there's no gravity necessarily

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
holding it

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,040
uh and the easiest example i could think

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
of

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,759
is one of these

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
oh that's terrible sorry

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,680
all right so here you go here's a car

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
you're like oh that's what it is

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
if i have a car and it's um well let's

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,879
just say for the sake of simplicity um

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,280
it is doing laps around a circular track

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,640
okay now quite obviously

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
if it's a normal sized car there's no

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,879
string with tension holding it toward

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
the center of the tracks right at the

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,239
same time we assume there's no enormous

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,239
body exerting gravity on the car that

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,599
keeps it on the track so how does it go

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,120
in a circle what is the force that keeps

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,760
it

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,160
face towards the inside any takers

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,239
the answer is it's friction

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
now hold on a second we're kind of used

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,840
to we're kind of used to the idea of

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,160
like even when we move around right

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
friction is kind of what slows you down

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,319
you you roll something and then

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
eventually it will stop because friction

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,840
will stop it right well the idea is that

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,519
friction

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,519
is mainly a reaction force right

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,760
when something's pushing against

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,920
something and then friction will push

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,720
back okay now what's happening is this

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,680
car is going around okay well according

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,920
to inertia right the first law

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
which way does that car with all of its

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,319
inertial mass which way does it want to

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,319
go

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,799
is it that there's there's two options

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,040
for inertia right it's either going to

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,280
be at rest is it at rest

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
no or it'll be

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,319
uniform

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,959
straight line motion right so what it

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,519
wants to do is not bend around like this

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,640
it wants to

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,519
keep going

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,080
right so the normal sort of situation is

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
the default situation for this car is um

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
is this kind of situation right so it's

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,680
going outward so therefore the friction

100
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,840
force it's reacting against that right

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
and so there's a sideways force acting

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
toward the middle and that's what's

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,159
keeping it

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,360
in the circular path right now that is

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,120
why it's so important that there is um

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
there is grip

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
on the tires

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,239
and on the road right because if you

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,560
take that grip away

110
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,720
then what happens there's not enough

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,000
friction right this will take over and

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,160
it'll skid outwards okay

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
so that's why you know rainy conditions

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
or if the tires on your car are really

115
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
old and bald and don't have enough grip

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,759
on them then you're going to have this

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
you're going to go off in the direction

118
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,960
of the tangent actually that's where

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,639
you're going to go

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
so this is kind of a problem but we sort

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,320
of overcome it with tires but there's

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
another way to overcome it there's

123
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,840
another way to overcome it so road

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,720
designers take advantage of these things

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
called

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,320
and here's our um

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,919
here's our final thing

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,919
what are called banked tracks

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,960
a bank track is where you are turning

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,120
around right what they do is they put an

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,000
embankment they raise part of the road

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
not all of it okay so that there's a

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,840
force acting inward okay i want you to

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,440
remember the ball the enormous two meter

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,560
across hemispherical ball we were

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,320
looking at right

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,039
okay we're looking at this yesterday

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
right we noticed that well okay you've

139
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,479
got

140
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,000
this circular path being traced out you

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,919
do have we had a string up here attached

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
which was exerting tension right but

143
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,600
then there was another force involved

144
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,360
that was also pushing in which force was

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
that

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,360
was the normal force right so if this is

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
where i am you know the normal force is

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,039
going there perpendicular to the surface

149
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
of the bowl or perpendicular to the

150
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,639
surface of whatever you're on um ball

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
cone all those kinds of things okay

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,680
so the bank tracks take advantage of

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
this let's draw one and you'll see

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,120
what's going on

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,600
first we'll do it side on so you do a

156
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,600
little sort of triangle like this

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
okay now this is a bit of exaggeration

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
um you almost never see a bank track

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
that is this steep but if we make it

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
realistic it's hard to see what's going

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,960
on okay

162
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,400
so instead of the road being flat okay

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,600
part of the road the outside of the turn

164
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,800
is embanked up okay and then this thing

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
it curves around

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,919
okay so there's the turn so we're

167
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,440
looking on from there just to make it a

168
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,360
little bit clearer i might put in

169
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
there's an edge here that we can't see

170
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,639
this outside bottom edge of the

171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,639
embankment so if i dot that

172
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,280
went a bit higher there you can kind of

173
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,840
see what's going on okay so

174
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
what's happened is as we go around this

175
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
turn

176
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,759
okay

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,960
there's going to be a normal force right

178
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
the normal force is going in that

179
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,240
direction so you can see when we resolve

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,400
it right it'll have a vertical part

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,080
right but it also has a horizontal part

182
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
that is centripetal it's headed toward

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,639
the center of the turn so this is going

184
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,880
to help our car stay on the road and not

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,039
do this thing okay

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,720
so to understand this situation and know

187
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,800
what's going on let's put a bit more on

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
detail onto this so catch up draw this

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,360
diagram and let's start to label some

190
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,360
bits onto it

191
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,240
we've got our normal force there

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
what's another force that's acting on

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,960
this thing

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
gravity good so let's put that on

195
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,440
okay there you go

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
now it's um it is circular you don't

197
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
need to have all of i mean you know we

198
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
talked about a car doing laps around a

199
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
circular track but that's not usually

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
what's happening usually we want to

201
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,520
actually do a turn and not just go round

202
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
and round and round

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,319
but there is still for this arc right

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
there is still a center to this okay

205
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,919
now watch out there's a couple there's

206
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
lots of different centers that i can

207
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,800
talk about here because there are lots

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,840
of different circles that i could draw

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,319
for instance here is a um a center of

210
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,240
the circle and it's on the flat of the

211
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
ground okay not on the higher banked

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
part right

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
but it's not very useful to us this this

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,280
particular center is not very useful to

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
us because if you're driving along in

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
your car right

217
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
so here's my car

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
and um you're driving along this road

219
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,639
okay

220
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,240
the center of the mass of the car right

221
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,639
should be on the center of the road and

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
that's why i've drawn my object and all

223
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
the forces acting on it i've drawn it at

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,800
the center there okay now that's raised

225
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,120
off the ground can you see that so

226
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,039
therefore i'm going to raise the center

227
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
that i'm interested in also off the

228
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,680
ground so something like here i'm

229
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,680
guessing

230
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,440
so there is the actual center of motion

231
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,040
if i picture a horizontal circle now it

232
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
lines up like this this would be the

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,519
radius

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,120
there's the radius of the actual

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
circular motion okay

236
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,519
i'll

237
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,600
mark that as the center okay

238
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,600
we need to know what angle this is

239
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
embedded at so i'll call this angle over

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
here theta

241
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
this is at a right angle

242
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,519
got a height

243
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,320
here

244
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,680
of the raised edge

245
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
and then lastly we need to know the

246
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,920
width of the road

247
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,160
so we'll call that

248
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
d for distance okay
