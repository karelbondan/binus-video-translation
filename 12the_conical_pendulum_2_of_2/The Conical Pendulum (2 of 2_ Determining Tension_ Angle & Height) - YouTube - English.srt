1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,359
now i think it was our problem this is

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,600
why and um if you have gone from this as

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,160
a basis you have inherited this problem

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,559
okay um this is a very clever way thumbs

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
up in terms of ingenuity for how to get

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,960
t

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
but there's a problem in i'll show you

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,880
what the problem is by appealing to the

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,960
first equation

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,560
right i'm trying to walk you through why

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
this is actually a bad idea not just say

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
it don't do it but

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
why

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,640
by appealing to this first equation

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
you've got now mass and gravity involved

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
right

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,239
now mass and gravity are both constants

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,640
right so when you put this into this you

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,879
just get more of a mess the more the

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,559
further you try and go with equation one

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
the more it explodes you get you get

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,000
square roots or you get like height

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
involved you get some other unknown

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
doesn't help okay so here's what i'm

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
gonna do i'm just gonna focus on this

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
equation here equation one not helpful

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,680
equation two

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
a little more useful

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,359
now what's the problem with equation two

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
well the problem i had with this was

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,199
that there's a theta in there right and

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,439
i don't want the theta there

33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
so here's the theta how do i get rid of

34
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,200
it

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
well if i know what sine theta is i can

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,080
just sub it out for something else that

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
i do know and in triangle c-o-p

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,240
theta's right there

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
and i have all these other things not h

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,240
i don't know what h is but i've got

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,479
these two that i do know right so in

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,840
this triangle

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,880
sine theta

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,880
sine theta is opposite on hypotenuse

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,520
okay with that

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,400
so now i'm going to take this this here

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,720
and

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,720
well i suppose

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
it doesn't matter really i'm gonna sub

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,159
this

51
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,600
into

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,399
um equation

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
two

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:57,439
okay watch what happens right uh it's t

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
times r on l equals m r omega squared

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,759
okay

57
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:06,040
um i can divide both sides by r and then

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,040
i can multiply by l

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,040
so

60
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
i would like to argue i think this is a

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,239
bit simpler okay but you can see can you

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
see why

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,879
why you're going this direction this

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,800
direction

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,120
rather than this direction ingenious as

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,599
it is you start to add in things which

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,800
which cloud the picture

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,200
all right there you go tension thumbs up

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
how do i get this angle now how do i

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
work it out

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
now

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,720
this time

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
this time both of these equations are

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,120
going to be more useful to us okay

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,280
because they both involve theta okay and

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
don't forget now i know what the tension

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
is okay so i can use this have a look at

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,800
equation two and one

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
equation two more

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
what's the easiest way to get this

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
unknown out of there but keep the theta

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,720
i think i should divide right adding

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
subtracting you're still going to have t

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,080
there so i'm going to divide

85
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,640
suggestions which way should i divide

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,319
two divided by one

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
okay so this is um what am i doing i'm

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,480
doing part b now

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,159
okay so your t's are going to cancel

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
sine theta and cos theta just gives you

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
tan

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,920
okay you even don't have to worry about

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,640
mass anymore okay so you're going to get

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,840
r omega squared on

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,879
g

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,879
so i just want the angle yeah

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
done

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,080
fell out just like that okay

99
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
all right now

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,319
last little bit let's see

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
how do i work out this height how do i

102
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
work it out well

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,920
with all of this information right we've

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
got we've got plenty of easy ways to get

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,159
there okay so probably now that we know

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,920
that tan theta is equal to this right

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,480
tan theta would give me a ratio between

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,640
these two sides right so back in this

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,920
triangle

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,840
c o p

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
right what's tan theta equal to it's

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
opposite on hypotenuse

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,400
which is

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
r over sorry opposite on adjacent r and

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
h yes

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
so there's that height that i'm after

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,479
okay uh i know what tan theta is

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,840
there it is

119
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,120
r omega squared on g

120
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,560
r on h

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
i can divide through by r because it's

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,600
not zero that's all good and so now i

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,600
just take the reciprocal h is equal to

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,840
okay

125
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,280
so here's our summary and let's see

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,840
what's useful about this one

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
two

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
three okay because they're not just

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
equations that are just hanging in

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,560
mid-air they tell you useful things

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,560
let's have a look at this one tension

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
what does it depend on it depends on

133
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,160
three things mass and length well those

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,360
are constants no big deal it depends on

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,720
omega as well so the faster

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,080
and you guys can experience this if you

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,240
have like a necklace or some other long

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
object you don't mind spinning okay

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
the faster you spin it right

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,240
the more tension you feel it tugging on

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,199
your finger right so as omega increases

142
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,199
angular velocity tension increases it it

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
pulls on you more

144
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,759
let's have a look at this next one look

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,080
at this

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,960
in the same way

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,520
you know rng constant no big deal but

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,440
omega as angular velocity increases what

149
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
happens to the angle

150
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
right that's why this angle it's up here

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
isn't it right it moves from going uh

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,440
just kind of small right it's a small

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,840
theta in here so as i increase angular

154
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,479
velocity it gets a really really large

155
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,560
theta approaching up to

156
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,160
pi on two i guess okay last bit

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
what happens when i increase omega here

158
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
because that's the only other useful

159
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,800
thing you can do increase omega

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
this is height i saw what's happening

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
height's this thing right so as i

162
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,520
increase angular velocity this gets

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,280
compressed right which you can see you

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,759
can see it look see it starts to

165
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,240
approach up toward the fixed point where

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,800
everything is suspended from okay so you

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,520
can see all of these things when you

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,199
understand how the equations interact

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,120
with each other and change

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,360
as you modify some of the variables does

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,360
that make sense
