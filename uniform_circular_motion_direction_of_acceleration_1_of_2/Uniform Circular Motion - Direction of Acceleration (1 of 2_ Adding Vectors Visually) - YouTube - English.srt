1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,520
this is the simplest kind of circular

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,680
motion

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,320
and it's where you have a constant

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
angular speed constant angular speed

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,880
right

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
now we're going to need to draw a new

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
diagram without people on it so draw me

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
a circle

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
okay roughly

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
and

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,359
we're going to think about this circular

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,640
motion okay so

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,480
i actually we're going to do some

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
constructions off of this okay and for

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
that reason you need to make your

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,359
drawing fairly accurate which is why i

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
got all the equipment out okay

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
significantly i want to ask you a couple

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,760
of things

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
firstly

21
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,920
this linear velocity right

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
if we're talking about uniform circular

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
motion

24
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,559
where the angular speed angle velocity

25
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
is constant so we're going around at a

26
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,000
constant

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,600
rate okay so we're making laps

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,719
consistently we're not speeding i'm not

29
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,079
slowing down okay

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,079
a constant here a constant omega is

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,480
going to imply a constant linear

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,800
velocity because r is a constant omega

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,400
constant whole thing's constant okay so

34
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
therefore if these two things are going

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,360
to go sort of complex numbers on you

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,840
right if these two lines represent

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
the velocity if they represent vectors

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,840
right it's got a direction that's why

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,479
i've got an arrow on there but this

40
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,000
length is important okay these lengths

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
in fact because it's constant they

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
should be the same okay so what however

43
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,840
big your circle is you know on mine one

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
of

45
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,240
these something like 20 centimeters

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
sorry

47
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,640
25. whatever they are i want them to be

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
the same on your diagram it doesn't seem

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,960
like it's going to be that important but

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,479
it will be okay

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
now i don't know if you've noticed i've

52
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,280
been a bit

53
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,960
funny with my language

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,000
i want to talk about this velocity okay

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
now we've already established that the

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,520
linear speed is constant

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,479
but

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
is

59
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,280
the linear velocity constant

60
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,840
it's my question

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,399
is the linear velocity

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,399
constant

63
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,880
now don't forget just to refresh your

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,360
memory right we've got two different

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,560
kinds of quantities in this in this

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,319
world that's 2d okay we've got scalars

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
and we've got vectors do you remember

68
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,560
what they mean what does it mean for

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,319
something to be scalar

70
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
it's just a value with a magnitude it's

71
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,560
just the size right so you can add up

72
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
scalar numbers together there's you know

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
like three and five they're scalars and

74
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,040
you get eight okay

75
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,519
but a vector makes it more complex not

76
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,840
only does it have a magnitude

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,480
but as we've been mentioning it has a

78
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
direction right so it's it's a scalar

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,160
right

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,160
plus another scalar

81
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,560
namely magnitude and direction so it's

82
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,840
got two values to it two parts and so

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
you know under complex numbers we talked

84
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
about the real part and the imaginary

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
part right

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
in this case we've got direction now can

87
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,080
you see

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,000
as you go around the circle

89
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
direction is constantly changing

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,040
you see that direction is constantly

91
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,920
changing at every different point let's

92
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,680
name them say p1 versus p2 okay

93
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
the velocity is changing because the

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
direction is changing the magnitude is

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
the same

96
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,239
right you've got the magnitude but the

97
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
direction

98
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,360
is not the same okay

99
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,040
so that means from this velocity to this

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,280
velocity there's a change right it's a

101
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,360
change in velocity

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,080
we have a name for that don't we

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
change in velocity what's that called

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
that's acceleration

105
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,959
so there's some acceleration in this

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,720
picture okay my question is where is the

107
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,720
acceleration going

108
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
now let's have a look at this okay

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799
let me just walk you through that just

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
in case you lost me there's a change in

111
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,480
velocity right

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
so step one i notice there's a change in

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
velocity

114
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
so step two i then conclude

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
therefore there must be acceleration

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,000
so then my question is where

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
what direction is it going in and then

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,959
i'm going to go toward the language of

119
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
forces i get two forces from

120
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,239
acceleration okay

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,759
all right now here's where the scale of

122
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,600
your diagram is going to be very very

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,280
important okay am i gonna have enough

124
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
space over there probably not i'm gonna

125
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
do it over here

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
um you've got your scale there you're

127
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,440
gonna need to draw some parallel lines

128
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:34,880
as well how do you work out acceleration

129
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,400
acceleration is change in velocity right

130
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
so for example

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,600
if i was traveling

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,520
at one point let's see let's start from

133
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
this side i was starting my journey and

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
i was traveling at 10 kilometers an hour

135
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,680
right and then by the end of my journey

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,240
i'm traveling at 30 kilometers an hour

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,120
10 kilometers an hour

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,560
30 kilometers now

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,440
how much have i accelerated

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,039
it's not a complicated question

141
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
i've accelerated

142
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,199
20 kilometers per hour right that's the

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
that's the net the resultant

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
acceleration okay so the way you got

145
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,960
that is you take the difference you just

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,400
do final speed final velocity minus

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,479
initial velocity and that's your

148
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,479
acceleration does that make sense so

149
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,919
obviously if i was just you know doing

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,160
the inertia thing and going 10

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,080
kilometers per hour

152
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,120
and 10 kilometers hour just uniform

153
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,720
straight line motion there's no

154
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,880
acceleration there right no force is

155
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
acting or at least no resultant forces

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
okay

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,720
so therefore let's take that

158
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
understanding and bring it over here

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
okay velocity

160
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
velocity

161
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
okay that's change in

162
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
sorry

163
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,360
acceleration that's what i'm trying to

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
work out

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
it's change in velocity

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,680
that's dv on dt

167
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
okay in this case i'm just picking two

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,160
particular points in time right

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,720
here's my final velocity and here's my

170
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,319
initial velocity just like here's my

171
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
final velocity and here's my initial

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
velocity so i'm going to say well this

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,400
is v2 minus v1

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
right in this case i got 20 kilometers

175
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
per hour in this case we've got zero

176
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
kilometers per hour what am i going to

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
get

178
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,479
here

179
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,720
now here's where you've got to be super

180
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
super careful okay

181
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
i'm going to try as best i can to

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
represent this on the board okay i

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
actually want you to draw

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,160
the vectors okay so if you can make your

185
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,360
lines parallel to preserve the direction

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,759
of each might look roughly like this

187
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
accept it for me okay final velocity

188
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,000
minus

189
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,039
initial velocity okay

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,039
no that's way too fast

191
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,000
okay that'll have to do right you can do

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
a much better job with me because you've

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
got like rulers and stuff you kind of

194
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,440
measure all that but they go

195
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,599
one vector and its velocity minus the

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
other one okay i might even label

197
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,720
there's b1

198
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,240
and there's

199
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
v2

200
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
now one of the things you may remember

201
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,199
from complex numbers is that when you

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,360
are subtracting vectors

203
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,479
subtracting vectors is the same as

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
adding

205
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,319
a negative vector in fact that's the

206
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,599
same in just like normal numbers right

207
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,560
like like

208
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
uh

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,400
30 minus 10

210
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,919
that's the same as

211
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
30 plus

212
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,039
negative 10 right so all i need to do to

213
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,800
work out what this is is to well i'll do

214
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,319
the first vector the same

215
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
so

216
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
there's v2

217
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,759
and now instead of subtracting this i'm

218
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,000
going to add now what would it mean for

219
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
this vector to be

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
negative

221
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,039
it means the um the line's the same

222
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
right it's still going to look like this

223
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
but because negative it's going in the

224
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
opposite direction

225
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,000
right that's that's the negative v1 if

226
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
you like okay now the reason why this is

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
useful to us is because when you add

228
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,280
vectors you just do one

229
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
and then you do the other right that's

230
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,039
all you have to do to add vectors

231
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
together so that's why i've got this

232
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,319
space over here

233
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,639
okay

234
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,879
let's put these together right something

235
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,879
like this

236
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,520
so there are my two vectors put together

237
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
which means that the the net result is

238
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
this

239
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,200
that's what the um that's what the

240
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,959
change in velocity is when you put the

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
vectors together and that distance and

242
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,240
the direction are crucial

243
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,560
they're based on these distances in

244
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
these directions okay now let's take

245
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,640
that vector and let's put it into the

246
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
picture okay because it's an average of

247
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,000
these two right i'm going to join these

248
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,000
up and get the midpoint looks like this

249
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
okay

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
now if you've done it well you take the

251
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,279
midpoint between those two positions and

252
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,240
you have a look at what direction that's

253
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,959
going in

254
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,959
it should be heading

255
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,200
right back toward the center at least if

256
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,080
you've drawn it accurately okay and we

257
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
have a um we have a word for this

258
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
where it's toward the center and our

259
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,279
fancy

260
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,120
long syllable word for this is

261
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,959
it's

262
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,519
centripetal right

263
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,440
aiming toward the center that's where

264
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,519
we're going

265
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
now i don't know how you feel about that

266
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
argument

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,640
um i i think it's quite kind of nice

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
like it's visual right but you know us

269
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,360
we're mathematicians so we want

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
something a little more rigorous than

271
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
this okay so here's what it looks like

272
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
visually

273
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,760
but we're going to need to do it

274
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
algebraically as well
