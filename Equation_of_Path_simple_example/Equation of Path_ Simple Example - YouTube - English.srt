1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,640
a stone is fired on a level floor so

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,080
that's convenient my diagram already

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,360
applies

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:15,160
with initial speed b equals 10

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,160
so i'm gonna have my arrow going up

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
the angle is 45 degrees so that's where

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,439
it's fired off at

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,960
that totally looks like 45 degrees

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,160
not tough okay

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
uh hey

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,039
find all of these equations of motion

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,880
right and then by eliminating t sure the

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
equation of the path is

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
that now this is this is the steps we

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,879
just did but with concrete numbers okay

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,239
so just for the sake of brevity you guys

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,440
are you shouldn't skip the constants

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,960
when you're integrating through but

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,239
let's just do it a little quicker just

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
so that we can see what's actually

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,520
happening and do the more interesting

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
parts of the equation okay

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
so

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
what do we got here

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
start off with your initial

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,559
equations for acceleration

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
so here's x double dot

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,239
no acceleration there

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
x not going to be a constant but you

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,119
already know what constant that's going

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,880
to be it's going to be v cos alpha v cos

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,280
alpha now i know what v is and i know

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,040
what alpha is so it's going to be

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,439
10 there's my v

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,920
cos alpha which is 45 degrees okay so

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,000
that's 10 on root 2 which is

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,000
5 2. yeah happy with that

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
okay great now we're going to integrate

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
again

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
and because it's just a constant you

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
slap your t on there

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,439
and because i'm actually starting the

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,200
origin the constant that's going to be

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,680
the second constant will also be zero

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
i'm just going to leave that there okay

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,439
all right now vertically

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
we're being affected by gravity and i

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,960
think they've taken it as -10

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,759
yes okay so therefore

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,399
acceleration sorry velocity that minus

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,320
10 to becomes minus 10 t

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,119
and then i'm going to have my plus

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,840
v sine alpha okay now this is v cos

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,560
alpha but because of this case being 45

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
degrees v cos alpha and v sine alpha are

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
going to be the same right so this is

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,360
just going to be 5 root two

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,520
five root two is a really creepy number

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
guys

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
for some reason it wasn't creepy here

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
but it's creepy over here

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
freaking me out okay

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,440
integrate one more time

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
all right

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,440
now what we want is an equation for

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,519
y in terms of x only so here's that

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
eliminating the parameter step yeah so

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
therefore i'll come over here and

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,040
remember we want to get t on its own so

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,200
t is just equal to x on 5 root 2.

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,519
okay so now when i bring this over onto

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,640
this side just be careful with brackets

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,080
and so on i've got minus 5 outside of

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,080
x on 5 root 2

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
squared right

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,159
plus

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,680
5 root 2 times x on 5 root 2.

78
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,120
okay

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
so you can see on that side that's a bit

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
easy that's just going to cancel

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,920
over here just to be cautious

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
what you're going to get is 5 root 2

83
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,959
squared over 2 squared that's

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,360
25 times 2

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,159
so that's 50 right so therefore you're

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,200
going to get 5 minus minus 5 squared on

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,720
50 plus x and there's the minus 1 over

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,840
10 that they were looking for because

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
it's actually a known

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,239
result okay

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,319
now

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,599
this is just the factorized form of that

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
this is what 10 minus x

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,080
okay

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,040
that look good part a done

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,120
part b now here's where it starts to

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,680
become clear why is it useful to

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,519
actually eliminate the parameter okay

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,840
having that parameter time is useful

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,239
when you're asking questions of when am

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,239
i so and so or how long is it going to

102
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
take me to do blah blah blah right so

103
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,079
for instance how long does it take for

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
the shell to hit the target okay but

105
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
when you've got this kind of equation

106
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
here it's independent of time so it's

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,960
just about getting the relationship

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,280
between how high am i versus how far

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,199
i've traveled horizontally okay and you

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
can use the quadratic theory that you've

111
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,840
learned in like

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,520
9 and y10 to get some really really easy

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
numbers out of this so for instance part

114
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
b says

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
find the range and the maximum height

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
range and maximum height so range means

117
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
this

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,680
how far does that what is it a stone how

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
far does the stone get okay now when you

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,880
think about this as a parabola you're

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
like well that range is just the

122
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,919
distance between the roots right so you

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
can read that off right the roots are 0

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,199
and 10.

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,680
okay so what i would actually say is by

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,680
quadratic theory

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
just to make it obvious where i'm

128
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,479
actually getting it from like what part

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
of quadratic theory am i getting it from

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,000
i put both roots there even though 10

131
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
minus 0 is trivial right but it shows

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,280
you i'm taking the difference between

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
those i'm not plucking a number out of

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,240
nowhere exactly

135
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,960
so there's my range

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
in a similar way they say um what's the

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,000
maximum height

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,080
so that's going to be up here now

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
because you know it's a parabola right

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
you know that the maximum height you

141
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
don't have to differentiate to find

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,600
where that is you just know it's halfway

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,080
between the roots it's on the axis of

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,800
symmetry so you take the right value

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,759
namely five and you substitute it in you

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,759
say max height

147
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,680
is equal to take your y equation and you

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,919
shove in five right

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,720
five over ten

150
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,960
ten minus five if you like just put on

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,479
the side here x equals five even though

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
it should be fair clear from your

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,120
substitution there you're gonna get a

154
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,440
half times five so it's two and a half

155
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
meters

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
okay

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
so that's kind of sweet right none of

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,639
this oh i have to work out when y is

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,039
equal to or work out velocity is equal

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,639
to zero yadda yadda yadda

161
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,319
you just read off the coordinates

162
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
because you know how it behaves because

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
it's a parabola right

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
part c now here's where they start to

165
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,600
vary things up suppose first that the

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,840
stone hits a wall eight meters away so

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,639
here's where your diagram comes in right

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
if it hits a wall eight meters away it's

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
obviously not going to get all the way

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,759
to what its full range is it gets

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,759
stopped short right so stick a wall in

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,759
there

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,599
okay there's my wall and it's eight

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,520
meters away

175
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,919
so the first part of that question i

176
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,919
should write uh part c part one

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,960
find how far up the wall the stone hits

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,800
okay now just before we solve this think

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,120
about how you would do this without

180
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,479
having eliminated the parameter kind of

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
tricky actually you've got to go through

182
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,759
a few steps work out be careful with

183
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,160
your horizontal vertical velocity but

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,039
here all i have to do is take x equals

185
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
eight

186
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,800
and sub it in that's it okay so i say

187
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,319
when x equals eight

188
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
y is equal to

189
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,560
eight on ten times ten minus eight

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
that's two

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,479
that's going to become 16 so it's 1.6

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,720
1.6 meters up

193
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,720
okay

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,919
differentiate the equation of path

195
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,879
and hence find the angle of inclination

196
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,879
when the stone hits the wall okay let's

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
think about this the equation of path is

198
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,840
this thing

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
i'm gonna go with that form rather than

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
the next one because

201
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,080
i don't need to um it's easy to

202
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
differentiate rather than this

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,639
factorized form okay so i can say part

204
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,800
two

205
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,599
the derivative of the equation of pi

206
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
right dividing dx is equal to

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
okay

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,520
two comes out the front so that's going

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,680
to be minus one over five x plus one

210
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
there's the derivative okay so i'm

211
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,400
interested in what's that equal to at

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,960
the point of impact right so when x

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,639
equals a

214
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,120
right dividing the x is going to be

215
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,840
let's see minus 8 on 5 plus one which is

216
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,440
minus three over five okay so that's the

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,360
gradient at that point

218
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
if i were to draw a tangent in there

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,399
right its gradient would be equal to

220
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,719
minus three fifths okay so if i want an

221
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,919
angle of inclination all i have to say

222
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,600
is m equals tan theta

223
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,880
okay so theta will be tan inverse of

224
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,880
minus

225
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
three fifths okay and you get an angle

226
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,399
of inclination out of that it's going to

227
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,160
be negative because it's dropping down

228
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,080
okay i'm not sure what the actual

229
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,279
decimal value is but

230
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
the mechanics of actually getting it is

231
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,120
very simple okay

232
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,920
all right

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,279
par d suppose now that the stone hits a

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,279
ceiling 2.1 meters high 2.1 meters just

235
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
be careful with your scale now as well

236
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,920
as this wall being here we said that

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,279
that top point was 2.5 so i guess just a

238
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,279
little bit below that will be 2.1

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,600
so there's my 2.1 meter

240
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,440
ceiling okay

241
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
find the horizontal distance before

242
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,839
impact horizontal distance before impact

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
so how far is it going to travel before

244
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,480
it actually hits the ceiling right so

245
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,600
therefore to solve that

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,279
because my line up here is not just 2.1

247
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,959
it's y equals 2.1 right

248
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
so solving for the points of impact is

249
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,839
actually very simple let me get rid of

250
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
this

251
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
this is part d

252
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,079
y is equal to

253
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,480
2.1 okay so therefore

254
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,279
2.1 is equal to minus

255
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,200
what was it 1 over 10

256
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,800
actually i think i had

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
this

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,279
okay so i'm going to multiply through by

259
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,760
10 to get rid of that icky looking

260
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,160
decimal value that gives me 21 is equal

261
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,600
to minus 10 x

262
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
plus

263
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,279
wait hold on what have i done that's a

264
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
plus no wait

265
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,839
no what have i done

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,839
that one yes all right that's right

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,160
that's correct

268
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,640
that's better okay great my problem is

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,480
facing the right way now so now put this

270
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,680
all on one side so it's nice and easy to

271
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,600
factorize x squared minus 10x

272
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,839
plus 21. and so the two numbers we're

273
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,120
after are

274
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
three and seven

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,480
or more specifically negative three and

276
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,480
negative seven

277
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
now out comes your two solutions which

278
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
is what you want to expect because all i

279
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
did was solve this equation here right

280
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,800
so there's solution one and there's

281
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
solution two okay now just like usual

282
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
when you get two solutions don't just

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,079
ignore one and be you know give it the

284
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,120
give it a silent treatment for no reason

285
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
you've actually got to say why you

286
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,959
disregard it okay so say

287
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,920
um as the stone

288
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,920
hits the ceiling

289
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
once

290
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,120
right

291
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
namely the first time okay it's not

292
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,200
gonna go through the ceiling cue creepy

293
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
music and then hit it on the second time

294
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,880
okay

295
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,880
therefore x equals three only right

296
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,279
so that was the first part of my answer

297
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,959
what was that horizontal distance x

298
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,720
equals three and then the second part of

299
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,240
the question was

300
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
uh let's see here find the angle at

301
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
which the stone hits the ceiling so

302
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,959
basically you're going to rinse and

303
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,200
repeat this step here take your

304
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,120
derivative pop in x equals three and

305
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,279
you'll get a different angle at the end

306
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
okay so you can see the kinds of

307
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
questions that you do with equation of

308
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,760
path you could do without having

309
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,360
eliminated the parameter but they're

310
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
just more direct and simple
