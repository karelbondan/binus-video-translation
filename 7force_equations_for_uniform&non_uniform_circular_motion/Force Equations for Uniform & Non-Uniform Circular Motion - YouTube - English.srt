1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
when you have a look at this diagram um

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
it's a bit tricky because you start to

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,559
get lost in you see why now i didn't put

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,719
on any more labels because it's it's

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
already pretty confusing okay the first

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,840
thing you got to do is you've got to try

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
and get theta in the picture you've got

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,080
to get thinner in the picture so you can

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
do your signs and causes and

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
trigonometry just like we did over here

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,480
okay i think you can probably see for

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
instance if i go from theta to here

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
right see this angle

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
this is a 90 degree angle because it's

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,279
the intersection between the horizontal

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,880
and vertical forces right so being

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
that's a 90 degree angle this is 90

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
minus theta but this is 90 over here

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,120
that's also a right angle so you've got

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
90 90 minus theta that leaves theta up

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,480
here does that make sense so you should

22
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,719
have it up there in the same way that i

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
did alternate angles in this diagram

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
you've got

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
theta over there as well okay

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
so if you went ahead and drew your

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
triangles carefully what you would have

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,719
found is you've got

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,120
this

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
component going along the normal and

31
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,920
then you've got where am i going to

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
write it up here

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,199
this component

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
going along the tangent okay so now we

35
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,400
have all of the pieces we have a counter

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
for the horizontal we accounted for the

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
vertical and now we can add everything

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,119
up okay so we're on a uniform motion

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
okay let's think about the normal first

40
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,680
the normal

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,759
because they're both kind of headed in

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
the same direction does that make sense

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,720
now when you're doing the normal all you

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,920
have to do is add up okay well i've got

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,320
f y sine theta and it's positive because

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,600
it's going away from the origin and then

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,600
you've got f y sorry f x

48
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,680
cos theta right

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,159
so that's all good but i know what f y

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
and f x are i spent all that time

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
developing that table going all the way

52
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
from displacement differentiate all the

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
way down multiply by mass what do you

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,479
get what is

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,799
fy

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,000
times sine theta and if my memory is

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,280
certainly i think you should get minus m

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,719
r omega squared i think and then this

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,840
one was cos theta so you're going to get

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
sine theta cos theta

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,959
isn't that what i did what have i got

62
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,640
oh right sorry it's squared i'm thinking

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
of the other one i'm doing the wrong way

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
better

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
cool

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,040
you play the same kind of thing with

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,080
your horizontal force multiplied by cos

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,040
theta so you're getting this

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,280
cos squared okay and you're like hold on

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
hold on sine squared plus cos squared

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
just a pythagorean identity there so

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,440
these both add up to one

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,640
right so then what are you getting

74
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,120
you're just getting minus m r omega

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,879
squared now just pause for a second do

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
you remember when we played our game and

77
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,239
considered

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
the vector in one spot and then the

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
vector in another spot we added them up

80
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,680
together and then we compared the change

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
we found the acceleration was pointing

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
toward the origin right and that was

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
kind of like a nice fancy geometric

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,200
trick but have a look at this can you

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,480
see why this tells you exactly the same

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,840
thing right this negative sign means

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,680
being this away from the center is the

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,280
positive direction then the negative

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,360
means you're going back in that

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,519
direction okay so along this axis

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,879
that's the force on the normal okay it's

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
pushing you back toward the center the

93
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,760
word we had for that was centripetal

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
remember that

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,519
okay let's have a look at the tangent

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
now right

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
so

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
be careful with this one though because

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,159
your horizontal force right you see how

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
it contributes this force but it's going

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
in the wrong direction right it's going

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
down this way okay so therefore what

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,040
you're going to have

104
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,040
is f i'm sure write this right fy cos t

105
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
that's going in the positive direction

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
but then you're going to

107
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,599
subtract

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,519
f x sine theta

109
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
is that right does that make sense okay

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,599
now this is what i was thinking of

111
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
before

112
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,840
because f y has the sine in it when you

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,840
multiply by cos that's going to give you

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
minus m r omega squared

115
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,439
sine cos

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
right

117
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
then you subtract because it's going in

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,799
the other direction but then when you

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
just substitute this in you've got

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,200
another minus

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
right

122
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,360
and it'll be m r omega squared it'll

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,640
also be sine theta

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,439
cos theta

125
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,560
right

126
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,560
okay so what does this mean

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
it means these two exactly cancel each

128
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
other out these two are going in

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,360
opposite directions in the same

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,880
magnitude right so your force along that

131
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,880
tangential axis is zero why is that

132
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,840
because

133
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,600
the whole scenario we started with

134
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,160
was that omega is

135
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
a constant right so i'm going around at

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,160
a constant rate i'm not speeding up as i

137
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,560
go around i'm not slowing down i'm just

138
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,280
going around at a uniform rate so

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
there's no force along this tangent axis

140
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,680
that's speeding me up or slowing me down

141
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
right if this was positive i'd be going

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,880
faster and faster faster if it was

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,840
negative i'd be getting slower and

144
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
slower and slower okay

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
so

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
a couple of things before we leave off

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
uniform motion you might notice you've

148
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,479
got your omega there right that means

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
that how long does it take me to go all

150
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,560
the way around

151
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
in other words what's the period of

152
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
motion because that's how long it takes

153
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
me to get back to the beginning

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,440
you can get this straight from omega

155
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,039
right

156
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,720
how far do you have to go to make one

157
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,639
full revolution answer two pi radians

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
right

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,199
period right this is time this is

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,080
distance over

161
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,000
speed right but speed is omega that's

162
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
how fast i'm going around

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,479
right so that's the period okay in

164
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,039
exactly the same way you can say what's

165
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,320
the frequency

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
how would you work out frequency from

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
that

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
think about it

169
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
how do we usually go you know when you

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,600
think your trig functions right

171
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,600
these guys

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,280
which by the way are exactly the same as

173
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,160
what you have here okay how do you go

174
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,479
from

175
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,479
period to frequency period to frequency

176
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
one over it's just isn't it just the

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,560
reciprocal of this it's just the

178
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,160
reciprocal of this it'll be omega over

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,319
two pi now it's not that you have to

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
remember those for me personally my

181
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,720
brain goes immediately here rather than

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
here but the questions will equally give

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,400
you either it'll say it goes around a

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
frequency up here 500 whatever's per

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,240
minute or something like that

186
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
or they'll tell you it takes me 15

187
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
seconds to go all the way around so

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
you'll see both of them okay

189
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,639
so that's the last thing i'm going to

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
say about uniform circulation before i

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,600
give you an example

192
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
i want to mention non-uniform circular

193
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
motion before we leave off because

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
there's a bunch of questions which are

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
just like this

196
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,960
but rather than omega being

197
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
some kind of constant right what they

198
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,360
say is well omega can change right or

199
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
maybe you can speed up or slow down

200
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
right

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
now think about it like this

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
how do we get to these forces how do we

203
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,199
get to here right well i can do a bit of

204
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,520
a shortcut for you remember when we did

205
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,000
our diagram

206
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,479
we said that velocity we just went from

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
the arc length formula right the

208
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,599
velocity along the

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,759
tangent is equal to now i think remember

210
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,919
this right i've got it written down here

211
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,440
it's just going to be r times omega

212
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
right does that make sense and that's

213
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,280
how we got that the further you were

214
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
away from the center you know like that

215
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,440
poor person on the outside of the circle

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,039
okay the faster you had to run right

217
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
because this gets bigger

218
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,000
all right so how would you go to

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,560
acceleration along the tangent if omega

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,560
was not a constant if it were a function

221
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,199
now i'm not telling you what the

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,639
function is it could be anything right

223
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
but the point is well r is going to be a

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,599
constant so i'm just going to chuck that

225
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,280
out the front okay and then you're

226
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,680
differentiating with respect to time

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,479
you're doing this make sense to get to a

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,080
force you know this kind of thing right

229
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,360
the force along the tangent is just

230
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
going to be just multiplied by mass

231
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,800
okay

232
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,759
now in order to maintain its

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,680
circularness okay so that i don't spiral

234
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,240
in and like you know sort of crash into

235
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
the origin or do the reverse not have

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
enough force holding me and so that i

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,319
just you know i go off and i i don't

238
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
stay within orbit i suppose okay

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
what you can say is that this is the

240
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,159
force along the tangent well the force

241
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,800
along the normal has to be exactly the

242
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,800
same as this

243
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
it has to be the same if it's not

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,919
exactly precisely equal to that you

245
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,480
won't get a circle okay and this um this

246
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
circular motion right that force that

247
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
you get

248
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
it can result from a whole variety of

249
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,959
things that's pulling you back toward

250
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,600
the center for instance it could be

251
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,560
now pause for a second think about this

252
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,200
think about this okay what's the force

253
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,959
keeping the keys

254
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
in circular motion because there's a

255
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
force keeping them there otherwise they

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
wouldn't do this right

257
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,399
i'm trying the best as i can to make it

258
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,000
uniform okay so we've got this zero

259
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
force okay what's holding it in

260
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
hmm now we don't usually think of it in

261
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,440
these terms right but this um

262
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,920
this lanyard right this lanyard is

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,160
exerting a force okay now just consider

264
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,160
this um at the moment

265
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
i can't oh here we go i'll do it like

266
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
this right

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
at the moment

268
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
this lanyard is not exerting any force

269
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,399
right because it's um nothing's

270
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,560
nothing's holding it tight okay but the

271
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,880
second i do this

272
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,800
the landing goes out straight right now

273
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,760
we have a name for that we call that

274
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,519
tension okay there's tension in the

275
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,160
what's it called in the lanyard right if

276
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,680
there's no tension if it was like say um

277
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,800
what's a what's a substance which has an

278
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,240
attention like something like plato or

279
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,320
something it would just stretch out and

280
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
it would go forever the force that's

281
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
pulling

282
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,240
um this out right because you know how

283
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,399
there's this force right what was the

284
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
third law of our motion

285
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,920
there's gonna be an equal and opposite

286
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,279
force going in the other direction right

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
so some people call that centrifugal

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,040
force right so that reaction force is

289
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,279
trying to pull away okay so there's no

290
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,200
tension in the lanyard it'll just fly

291
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,440
off okay so i should watch this more

292
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
carefully but there is tension in the

293
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,240
string okay in the lanyard and that's

294
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,760
this tension here it's holding it in

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
circular motion yeah by the way there's

296
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
plenty of other things we know in our

297
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,720
common experience uh even if we don't i

298
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,920
mean we see them up in the sky what

299
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
other kinds of things are going to hold

300
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,800
things in circular motion

301
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,279
things like say gravity right so that's

302
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,040
holding things like i know you know

303
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,040
if i put an earth here

304
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,959
there's an earth okay um

305
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
this thing is exerting that force along

306
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
the normal and that's gravity we're

307
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,839
familiar with that right

308
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,920
so this force

309
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
or that force it's the same thing okay

310
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,399
you can get it from gravity

311
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
you can get it from tension

312
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,800
and you can get it from a few other

313
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
places as well that we're going to

314
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,839
notice in

315
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,720
the following week okay but that's the

316
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
important thing that's what this

317
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,079
represents okay
