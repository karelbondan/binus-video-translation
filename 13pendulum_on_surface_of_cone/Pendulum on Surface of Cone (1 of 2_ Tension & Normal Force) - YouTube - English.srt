1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,920
pens up let's let's draw a diagram okay

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,560
a smooth circular cone okay i'm going to

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,560
draw it like this

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,559
okay um you don't know where it ends

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,880
they don't tell you how tall it is it

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,920
doesn't matter though because it's all

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,520
pretty consistent there's my cone

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,000
vertex up

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,000
axis

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
is vertical okay so there you go facing

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
upwards is not at an angle

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
it has a semi vertical angle of 60

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,160
degrees uh we know what semi means right

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,280
semi think about like conics

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
semi just means half right like

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,559
semicircle okay so the semi vertical

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,360
angle of 60 degrees is in there okay

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,680
a particle of mass one kilogram mass

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,680
mass

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,840
one kilogram

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,239
is attached by a light inelastic stream

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,160
from a point vertically above the vertex

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,440
of the cone so i'll call that c up there

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
p moves with constant speed v meters per

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,880
second

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,799
so that's a linear speed isn't it it's

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
not an angular speed because it's meters

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,880
per second not radians per second

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,240
v means per second

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,720
on the outer surface of the cone

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,360
in a horizontal circle okay so

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,840
it's sitting on top of this cone and it

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,400
traces

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,360
out this this circular path here okay so

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,360
let me throw that in

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
that's pretty awful but you get the

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,920
picture all right so there's p

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,600
over there

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
okay it's moving around and that

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,280
horizontal circle

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,360
has a radius of 0.5 meters so here is

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,079
the center of the horizontal circle i

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,520
guess we'll call that o okay and that

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,320
radius there

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,320
0.5 meters

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
the string makes an angle of 30 degrees

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
with the vertical so we already worked

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,520
out where the vertical is it lines up

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,319
with the axis of the cone

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
30 degrees

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440
okay

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,080
so then there are a few questions um

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,120
and i'll leave this guy here okay

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,319
part a

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,040
can we get

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,360
a horizontal force

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
and a vertical force

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,440
there's the first question

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,879
second question if

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
we know what the velocity is let's call

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,599
it one meter per second okay

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,360
find the magnitude of the tension in the

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
string

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
and

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,000
the reaction force

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,760
on the cone of the cone on p i'll talk

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
about that in a second

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,760
of cones

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,000
on a pin okay last question

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,760
um i'll read it to you find the maximum

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
value of v

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,640
find how fast you can go

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,959
that lets p maintain contact with the

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
code

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,840
find the maximum value v

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,519
that lets p maintain contact with the

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
code okay you now know this right we

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
looked at this we just derived this

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,360
example okay if i increase v enough

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,800
right right now it's on the surface of

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
my imaginary cone there but if i

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,879
increase v it'll lift off okay does that

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,319
make sense so there's clearly some upper

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,519
limit on what that velocity is we want

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,599
to try and find that okay so

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,959
maximum v

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,959
to remain on current

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,959
question mark okay

89
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
have a go start off remember we've

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
already started our diagram but there

91
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,480
are no forces on it yet okay so why

92
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,920
don't you put all the forces there

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
use colors if you can because it really

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,879
helps you distinguish all of them and

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,599
then i'll give you a couple minutes head

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,599
start and then i'll do it

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
okay

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,680
so the first easy bit is your gravity no

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,760
problems okay it's mg but you know that

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,720
the mass is just one so i i put the one

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,640
there just kind of for completeness okay

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
so there's gravity going down then

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,480
you've got tension going up along the

104
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
string so far so good so you've got a

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
vertical component you've got a

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,720
horizontal button has anyone worked out

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
what those are yet

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,959
you know worked out when they're done

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
okay have a look let's just do it

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,120
quickly now okay you've got um

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,479
this angle in here right so you can work

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
out what this

113
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,000
is through the same trig sort of thing

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,440
that we worked out before okay i'm

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
pretty sure it's going to be you have 30

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
degrees here right so you want this and

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,040
it's the adjacent side so it's going to

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
be t cos theta

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,240
is that okay i know you know what cos 30

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
is but i'm just showing you that so you

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
can see where i got it from

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,360
same deal you're going to get t sine 30

123
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
going in the horizontal direction so

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,720
just squeeze that in

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,479
okay now i've accounted for two forces

126
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
right and i've resolved them up down

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,040
left right okay but there's a force i'm

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,919
missing there's a force i'm missing okay

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,800
now it's easy to illustrate

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,560
if i show you something like this okay

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
so you've got an object and it's resting

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
on a surface okay now at least at the

133
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,080
moment it's not going anywhere

134
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,600
right so you've got gravity going down

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
and then you've got

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
reaction force going up and that's why

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,199
it stays put okay

138
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,600
ah but now

139
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,000
if i tilt this right so i'll move this

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,320
up here if i put this at an angle like

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,400
this

142
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,560
well it slides off wait what happened

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
why did it slide off

144
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,880
i wasn't i wasn't i wasn't pushing it or

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,560
anything what was exerting force in

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
another direction to make it move

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
because we know because of inertia if

148
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,240
there wasn't some force making it move

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,360
it would stay put why when i tilted it

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
did it

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,840
well sorry floppy board did it go from

152
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,440
its stable position

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
to its

154
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,479
unstable position

155
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,759
why why

156
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
this is all i did i just tilted it like

157
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
that

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,600
and the answer is right the reaction

159
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,160
force that's being exerted by this book

160
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,720
it will exert only in one particular

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,280
direction namely whatever direction the

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,520
surface is facing in now right now that

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
surface is exactly opposite facing to

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
gravity

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,880
directly up but the second it's not

166
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
directly facing gravity if i go off like

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
this okay

168
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,520
now it's facing well where's it facing

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
um it's facing off in that direction

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
okay so it's exerting some force that

171
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,280
way which is why the keys slide off that

172
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,800
way does that make sense so to summarize

173
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
this current this is the difference

174
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
between you know magical things floating

175
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,919
out in mid-air or it's sitting on a cone

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,840
the cone is exerting its own force its

177
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,560
reaction force and it's going

178
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,680
perpendicular

179
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,160
perpendicular to the surface of the cone

180
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,000
just like it was going perpendicular to

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
the surface of the book

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,759
okay so i've got this tension going up

183
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,400
this way and then i've got the cone

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,360
going off that way okay now because it's

185
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,280
perpendicular rather than call it the

186
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
reaction force which is a bit generic

187
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,759
okay

188
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,240
we'll call it n n for normal okay so

189
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,440
i've got n going this way

190
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,400
all right so now more colors

191
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,479
what force is n exerting horizontally

192
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,039
and vertically

193
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,680
let's have a look uh it's got a it's got

194
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,160
a vertical component right i can see it

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,160
like this

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
up

197
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,880
like that

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
have a look at the horizontal component

199
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
it's not taking it toward the center

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,440
it's taking you away from the center why

201
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
is it doing that

202
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,440
why would it be pushing you away from

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
the center

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
what would happen if it wasn't pushing

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,280
away from the center

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
the the thing would just go straight

207
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,440
into the cone right but it's not it's

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,440
pushing back it's like no no you stay on

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,919
your circular path out there so these

210
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,000
two right they're pushing out okay so

211
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,680
you're these two forces let me um

212
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,360
let me save you a bit of time i'm going

213
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,599
to put my piece of it

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
underneath let me save it a time and

215
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,240
tell you what those forces are you've

216
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,120
got a vertical force here of

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,120
oops sorry that's not clear

218
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,319
goodbye people who have to go thank you

219
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,599
okay

220
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
um

221
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:27,120
where am i

222
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:29,840
oh right okay you got n cos 60 here and

223
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,599
n sine 60

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,240
there okay you can go ahead and you can

225
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,320
double check the triangles okay

226
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,640
all right

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,640
finally i've got a diagram it's got all

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,800
the forces on there i used trigonometry

229
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
to work out what all these sizes were

230
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,320
all of the different bits right

231
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,880
i started to resolve but i'm not

232
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,040
finished right i know what they're equal

233
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,480
to when i add everything up okay so

234
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,760
let's do vertically first because it's

235
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,279
boring

236
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,240
vertically

237
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,240
what kind of motion is there

238
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,320
it's a horizontal circle so vertically

239
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
it's not going anywhere

240
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,600
okay so if i add up all of these up down

241
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,399
forces they should all sum to zero right

242
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,920
okay so i've got let's see here these

243
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
ones are going up these ones are going

244
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,320
down so they should oppose each other so

245
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,560
i've got t cause ooh if i switch these

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,560
around

247
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,080
i know i have i have some triangles

248
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,080
wrong

249
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,040
i think this should be

250
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
oh no no it's okay yeah no no no no i

251
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,920
was right in the first place it's okay

252
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
um you can look at it from other

253
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,120
triangles point of view but you get i

254
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,800
think it costs 30 just the same thing or

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,720
cos 60. it's just looking at it from a

256
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
different triangle anyway

257
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,800
ah where am i i've got this

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,600
um t cos

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,160
30 and n sine 60 they're going up

260
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,560
and then you've got gravity going down

261
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,680
is that all right okay so

262
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
i know what both of these are they're

263
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,839
both root three and two okay so i'm

264
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
going to save myself a bit of time and

265
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
just divide everything through by root

266
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,560
three and two which gives me two g on

267
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,560
root three is that all right

268
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,440
equation one which i got from vertical

269
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,640
okay

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
horizontally what's going on

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,399
horizontally i have uniform circular

272
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
motion

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
so

274
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
these two forces which are going in

275
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,720
opposite directions right so there's

276
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
going to be

277
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,160
i'm going to say a plus in this way and

278
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
a minus out that way because i'm heading

279
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,079
back toward the center that's my my

280
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,279
default view okay they should add up to

281
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
m r

282
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,519
omega squared right so you're going to

283
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,519
get this

284
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,240
let's see

285
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,200
30. so i'm calling positive by the way

286
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,880
in towards the center because that's my

287
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,880
default mode okay maybe i should put

288
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,320
that in

289
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,240
positive okay

290
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,279
so t sine 30 minus n cos 60 because

291
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,800
that's the normal force pushing out okay

292
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,399
now i could call it i could call it m r

293
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,560
omega square but it turns out that's not

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,680
such a useful way to phrase it in this

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,959
situation why not

296
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
because i don't know anything about

297
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,000
angular velocity right i only know

298
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,720
linear right so instead of m rm squared

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,760
what was our alternative in terms of v

300
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,720
and v squared on r right

301
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,360
okay so i'm going to do that instead

302
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
m v squared on r

303
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,959
okay

304
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,519
all right now i know what m is right

305
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
it's just one i know what the radius is

306
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,320
it's

307
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
uh it's a half isn't it

308
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
uh-huh right

309
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,399
and i know what these are they're both

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,399
going to be equal to a half as well okay

311
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,480
so far so good so i'm going to multiply

312
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,600
everything by two that'll get a rid of

313
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,519
these guys

314
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,519
should put this guy up save you a bit of

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,279
time here's what you get

316
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
are you content with that so i've

317
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
divided by half here and then i've

318
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,519
multiplied by two from here okay

319
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,279
equation two

320
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
well done

321
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,399
that's that right that's that's what i

322
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,040
got from there i have my vertical and my

323
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,720
horizontal forces now all resolved out

324
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,519
okay including um gravity and

325
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,800
the tension and the normal that's coming

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,800
from the cone
